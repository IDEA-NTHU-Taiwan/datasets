This paper, prepared by the Climate Change Technology Subcommittee, a subcommittee of the Power and Energy Society Energy Development and Power Generation Committee, identifies key technical issues facing the electric power industry, related to global climate change. The technical challenges arise from: 1) impacts on system operating strategies, configuration, and expansion plans of emission-reducing technologies; 2) power infrastructure response to extreme weather events; 3) effects of government policies including an expanded use of renewable and alternative energy technologies; and 4) impacts of market rules on power system operation. Possible lessons from other industries' responses to climate change are explored.
