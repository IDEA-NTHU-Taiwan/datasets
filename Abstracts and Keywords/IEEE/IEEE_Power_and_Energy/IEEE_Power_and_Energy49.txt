With the operation of long transmission lines, unknown severe vibration and noise in transformers have sometimes been observed at the Shanghe substation and at the Ling'ao nuclear power plant in China. This paper gives a comparison of magnetic-storm recordings and measured transformer neutral current data and confirms that the disturbances were caused by geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). On November 7 and 9, 2004, the maximum GIC at the Ling'ao nuclear power plant was 47.2 A and 75.5 A, respectively, which are both larger than the neutral DC current caused by the HVDC monopole operation. The analysis of GIC data indicates that the GIC level is mainly determined by the geomagnetic-field variation rate, but the earth conductivity and power grid parameters are also important factors affecting GIC values. The data show that the GIC level is higher at the Ling'ao nuclear power plant than at the Shanghe substation. The reason is considered to be related to the grid structure and to the coast effect. Furthermore, because of smaller resistances, longer transmission lines, a larger scale, and the adoption of single-phase transformers, the influences of GIC on the ultra-high voltage power grid being constructed in China need to be studied more urgently.
