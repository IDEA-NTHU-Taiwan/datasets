A revision of an ESOP-based Toffoli gate cascade synthesis technique is presented. The cost metric used previously was replaced with a new cost metric based on autocorrelation coefficients to determine the placements of Toffoli gates. The algorithm remains capable of generating reversible circuits for large functions within reasonable time.
