Possibility of a method ellipsometry application for investigation of the multi-layer films and structures was shown. Reliability of obtaining data was confirmed with independent method of X-rays photoelectron spectroscopy. Layerwise composition of HfO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si stack was studied. It was shown that interfacial layer of hafnium silicate was formed between HfO<sub>2</sub> film and Si substrate. Investigation of the HfO<sub>2</sub>/Si, ZrO<sub>2</sub>/Si, Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>/Si, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Si structures after annealing in oxygen ambient disclosed that the oxides under study were permeable for diffusion of oxygen. As a result the thickness of SiO<sub>2</sub> layer was increased during annealing process. It was revealed, that Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-films were oxygen-tight. The developed ellipsometric method was used for optimization of the (HfO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>x</sub>(Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>1-x</sub> layers obtaining.
