Fusing theory and practical in a curriculum for engineering students is a core academic function of a University of Technology. The department of Electronic Engineering at the Vaal University of Technology places particular emphasis on this fusion by means of interactive classroom sessions combined with methodical laboratory work. A previous paper, presented at AFRICON 2007, highlighted several key reasons as to why this fusion must transpire in a curriculum for engineering students. However, comments received from the delegates at that conference highlighted one notable deficiency in the results. The theory before practical approach was only applied to a single experiment on phase lock loops, while the practical before theory approach was solely used with a transmission line experiment. It was therefore suggested that these two approaches be reversed with regard to the relevant practical assignments. The theory before practical approach revealed a much higher average pass rate over the three year study period, proving it to be the preferred method for fusing theory and practical in a curriculum for engineering students. Nevertheless, this study did reveal that a mixed-method approach is still viable for senior engineering students.
