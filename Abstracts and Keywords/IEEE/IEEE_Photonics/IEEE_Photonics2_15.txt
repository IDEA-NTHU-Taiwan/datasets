This paper develops a particle filter locator for atmospheric thermal flows. The underlying thermal model is more detailed and general than the Gaussian models typically used. The implemented particle filter is a regularized and adaptive version. This filter handles thermals global localization and the underlying non-linear models, providing excellent results.
