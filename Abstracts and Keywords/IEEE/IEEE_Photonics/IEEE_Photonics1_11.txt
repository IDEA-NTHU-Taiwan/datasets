In this work we present the formation of dark photonic lattices in negative nonlinear medium. Bright periodic lattices are generated by interference technique and propagated through 1 cm of length of nonlinear medium (R6G with acetone). The dependence with the laser (Ar) power and the geometry selected are showed. Three very interesting cases were obtained: two dimensional dark photonic lattices (2D), one dimensional dark photonic lattices, and (1D), and 2D and 1D combination effects. Our experimental results are accord with numerical simulations.
