This paper describes seamless transitions among various MOS devices, ranging from bulk and partially/fully-depleted SOI to double-gate FinFETs and silicon-nanowire MOSFETs. The underlying governing equations for various structures are outlined, which provide the motivation for unifying MOS compact models with the unified regional modeling (URM) approach.
