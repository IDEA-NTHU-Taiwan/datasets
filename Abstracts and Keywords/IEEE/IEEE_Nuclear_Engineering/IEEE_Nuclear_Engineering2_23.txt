MEMS and nanotechnology have become significant new technologies in just the past 15 years. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has provided key research and development funding for both academic and industrial laboratories that has driven new research directions and commercial products. DARPA's experience has identified five management of technology themes that have defined the evolution of the MEMS research and development and commercial communities. These same themes are directly applicable in the exciting new and still emerging field of nanotechnology.
