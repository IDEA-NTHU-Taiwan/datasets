Korean ITER participation impacts huge things on her fusion research as an energy development program. The ITER Transitional Arrangements (ITA) is conducted by the International Team with supports from participant teams. The Korean participant team (KO-PT) has contributed to the ITA by sharing several technical tasks to verify feasibilities of fabrication and quality control method in procuring ITER equipments and facilities. Technical data to confirm validity of the present design have also been developed on some issues. Completing these technical preparations will make it possible to finalize the specification of ITER procurements. This presentation provides an overview focusing on critical activities needed for the successes of ITER project and fusion energy development
