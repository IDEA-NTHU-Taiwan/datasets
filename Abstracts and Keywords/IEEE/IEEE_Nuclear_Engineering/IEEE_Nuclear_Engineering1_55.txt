Saline irrigation decreased the evapotranspiration (ET) of Haloxylon Ammodendron Bunge (H. Ammodendron) and Caragana Karshiskii Kom (C. Karshiskii) via reducing transpiration water, and it also changed the proportion of transpiration in ET: the proportion of evaporation from soil surface increased, and the proportion of transpiration in ET decreased when irrigating with higher salt concentration. The ET, soil evaporation and transpiration of H. Ammodendron irrigated with salinity of 7g/L and 12g/L reduced by 20% and 42%, 1.97% and 12%, 24% and 50% respectively compared to the plants irrigated with freshwater, while the reductions for C Karshiskii were 27% and 38%, 17% and 18%, 31% and 44%, respectively.
