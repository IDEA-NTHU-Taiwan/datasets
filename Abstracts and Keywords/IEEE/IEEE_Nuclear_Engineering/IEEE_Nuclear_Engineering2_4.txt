Since 2000, the JET Facilities have been exploited under the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) and have played a key role in the preparation of ITER, in particular by operating in deuterium/tritium plasmas, optimising remote handling and consolidating ITER operating scenarios with increasing heating power. JET has undergone significant enhancement during this period. A first enhancement programme is now approaching fruition as the present shutdown nears an end. The experimental campaigns are due to resume in November 2005 with an improved divertor, increased heating power and around 20 new diagnostics. A second enhancement programme, to be completed by the end of 2008, is already underway, and will enable major experiments in support of ITER. This includes the installation of a new first wall with an ITER-like materials combination, a further upgrade of the neutral beams, an upgraded plasma control system, a high frequency pellet injector and a number of diagnostics key for ITER technology and physics
