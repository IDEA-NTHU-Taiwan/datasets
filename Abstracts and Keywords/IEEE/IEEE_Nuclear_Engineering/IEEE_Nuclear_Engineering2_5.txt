The line of the Wendelstein stellarators developed in IPP is being continued with a superconducting device, Wendelstein 7-X. This fully optimised stellarator which shall demonstrate the reactor potential of the Helias-type stellarator, is presently under construction in the Greifswald branch institute of IPP. Manufacturing of the W7-X components has progressed well over the last years, and assembly of the device has started early in 2005
