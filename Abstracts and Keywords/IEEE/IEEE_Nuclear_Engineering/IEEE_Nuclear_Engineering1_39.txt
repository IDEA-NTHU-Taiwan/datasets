This paper studies the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of various lighting systems that are T-8 fluorescent lamps with standard ballast, T-8 fluorescent lamps with low-loss ballast, T-8 fluorescent lamps with electronic ballast and T-5 fluorescent lamps with electronic ballast. The LCC of residential customers, small general service customers, medium general service customers and large general service customers are evaluated by considering initial cost, energy cost, maintenance cost and savage cost for the assessment in Thailand. The analytical results show that T-5 fluorescent lamps with electronic ballast can reduce the LCC of fluorescent lamps up to 3,177, 3,948, 3,619 and 3,382 for residential customers, small general service customers, medium general service customers and large general service customers, respectively. In addition, the LCC of T-5 fluorescent lamps with electronic ballast are less than the LCC of T-8 fluorescent lamps with standard ballast, the LCC of T-8 fluorescent lamps with low-loss ballast, and the LCC of T-8 fluorescent lamps with electronic ballast by 20%, 15% and 9% for small general service customer. According to the information from department of demand side management, EGAT (Electricity Generation Authority of Thailand), 200 million of T-5 fluorescent lamps with electronic ballast can decrease the peak demand up to 2,000 MW and 5 million tons of CO<inf>2</inf> emission. Finally, the sensitivity analysis shows that the most influent factors for LCC is the electricity tariff rate, following by the cost of light bulbs and accessories, and the reverse life time of equipment respectively.
