We examined if there is a P limitation on microbial activities and the accompanying gas emissions in a humid tropical forest soil of South Sumatra, Indonesia. The soil was incubated for 30 d with and without adding P (Ca(H<inf>2</inf>PO<inf>4</inf>)<inf>2</inf>; 2 mg P g&#x00B7;soil<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) after adjusting water-filled pore space (WFPS) to 75% or 100%. The cumulative CO<inf>2</inf> emission during 30 d (mg C kg&#x00B7;soil<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) increased by P addition from 751 &#x00B1; 105 to 959 &#x00B1; 66 and from 1096 &#x00B1; 36 to 1294 &#x00B1; 47 at 75% and 100% WFPS, respectively, suggesting that the soil microbial activity was limited by P. P addition also increased the cumulative N<inf>2</inf>O emissions (from 10.2 &#x00B1; 5.08 to 19.9 &#x00B1; 6.91 and from 1405 &#x00B1; 161 to 1977 &#x00B1; 179 at 75% and 100% WFPS, respectively) and the cumulative NO emissions (from 354 &#x00B1; 25.9 to 774 &#x00B1; 52.7 and from 117 &#x00B1; 14.7 to 272 &#x00B1; 19.4 at 75% and 100% WFPS, respectively) during 30 d. N<inf>2</inf>O/NO ratios were always smaller than 1 at 75% WFPS, ranging from 0.03 to 0.70, while always larger than 1 at 100% WFPS, ranging from 40.3 to 94.5, suggesting that the N<inf>2</inf>O and NO were emitted mainly from nitrification at 75% WFPS and denitrification at 100% WFPS. Thus nitrification and denitrification in the soil was also limited by P. We suggest soil microbial activities and the emissions of CO<inf>2</inf>, N<inf>2</inf>O, and NO in tropical forest might be limited by P availability, and P shortage in tropics might be suppressing the emissions of these unwelcomed gases.
