The contents of Lead and Cadmium in the 12 soil samples along Badaling highway, Airport highway and Jingshi highway were determined. Sequential extraction technique was used in the study to extract and determine the lead and cadmium forms in soil samples along the above-stated 3 roads. The results revealed that the soils along the above highway are polluted by Lead and Cadmium from the tail gas of automobiles. The content of Lead and Cadmium are higher than background value in Beijing area: 4.41-6.69 and 2.69-6.48 times respectively. The lead and cadmium in soil mainly exist in forms of FeMnO<sub>x</sub> O.M. and Res. with low biological validity. The carbonate lead and carbonate cadmium in soil will be released to be Exc. form to show high biological toxicity. The geo-accumulation index was adopted to assess the Lead and Cadmium pollution in the soils along the highway in Beijing area, indicating that the soil is moderately polluted.
