The variation characteristics of runoff and sediment transport in main hydrologic stations of the Dongting lake was analyzed by methods of mathematical statistics, Mann-Kendall, wavelet analysis and accumulating filter from 1956 to 2008. The results show that: (1) the water and sediment entering Dongting Lake are mainly from four rivers of Hunan and the three outlets of Jinjiang River, respectively, accounting for 59.2% and 80.9% of the total. (2) the water and sediment entering Dongting Lake from the three outlets decreased significantly, because of the impact of cutting off of Jinjiang, using of Gezhouba, damming up of the Three Gorges Reservoir and water and soil conservation of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, The water and sediment entering from the three outlets drop from 42.6% and 87.7% before cut-off to 21.7% and 59.6%, respectively in the initial operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir. (3) In recent 50 years, the total sediment deposition has reached up to 52.9&#x00D7;10<sup>8</sup>t, however, the sediment deposition rate drops significantly from 73.3% before the Jinjiang cut-off to 34.0%in the initial operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir. The sediment decrease is favorable for the maintenance of its regulation and volume as well as the prolonging its life; in the initial operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir, however, the decrease of water and sediment from the three outlets may also aggravate the shortage of water supply in low water period in the west of Dongting Lake, at the same time the sediment accumulation from the following sections of Chenglingji leads to the rising of flood level in Dongting Lake.
