Work Internship Placements (WIP) is a transversal programme of enterprise internships for the engineering students of UdG which is focused on quality improvement, academic control and satisfaction of collaborating enterprises. The fundamental WIP infrastructure is a web-based intranet platform that provides a complete set of WIP tools, procedures and tasks involved in all internships stages for every participating agent: enterprises, students, coaching professors and administrative staff. Our new programme is centered on a broader, more holistic internship placement procedure than the traditional &#x201C;career and academic goals&#x201D; approach. The WIP programme has been found to be a valuable asset in addressing enterprise and student needs in the experiential project.
