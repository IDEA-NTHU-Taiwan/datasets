One of the outstanding ways of enhancing human capital development is rooted in collaboration and leadership. No enterprise can make progress in whatever its endeavor if collaboration and leadership is poorly addressed (Jeston and Nelis, 2008). Collaboration is needed in every sectors of life (family affairs, educational accomplishments&#x2026;). Collaboration may be horizontal (as in play groups) or horizontal (as in teacher to student relationship). Leadership can exist both in horizontal or vertical collaboration. The question at the heart of this work is: How can leadership in collaboration be characterized and explored to enhance human resource sharing? To answer this question, leadership attainment, collaboration typologies and leadership style were used to propose a model in a second order collaborative environment. Collaboration is deemed to produce contributions that can be personalized and shared contributions. Shared contribution is stored in a digital form for its global access.
