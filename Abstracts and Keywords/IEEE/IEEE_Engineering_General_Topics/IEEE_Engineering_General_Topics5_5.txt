E-learning systems such as computer based training (CBT) and Web based training (WBT) are globally proving their reliability and importance with respect to traditional knowledge gaining methods. In healthcare, a huge potential to apply these techniques is observed and consequently, new research opportunities are increasingly taking our attentions (e.g., Telemedicine). The integration of e-learning and healthcare systems is expected to leave a huge impact on countries wherein certain knowledge is hardly available (i.e., developing nations). Egypt is the case study selected for having major problems in healthcare. This research methodology is qualitative with proof of some empirical data, gathered from experiments held online for a group of Egyptian healthcare professionals using two different delivery techniques of content with the same pedagogical strategies. In an attempt to analyze the driven results after delivering this e-course using two different techniques, it was concluded that the WBT method was better as a more learner-centered, motivating, content-focused, allowing collaboration and discussion between peers, at effective timing, however it was harder to implement. While the CBT method which was distributed at a larger scale, as a stand-alone solution where people took at their convenient time and place, but it was neither interactive nor the objectives were clear. Comparing both techniques would help future work in this area.
