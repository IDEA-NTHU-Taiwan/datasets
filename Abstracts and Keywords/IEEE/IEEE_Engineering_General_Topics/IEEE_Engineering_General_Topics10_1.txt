E-learning has been a de facto solution for almost all higher learning institutions. The adoption has been proven to successfully aid students in their learning activities. However, there has been lack of study in further understanding the usability of e-learning courseware and its significance in the instructional design process. Therefore, we seek to explore user characteristic, users cognitive styles, their current views about e-learning usability and perceived importance of its usability design features. A survey was conducted in one of the universities in Malaysia where e-learning courseware is extensively deployed. Discussion of the findings is provided.
