Vocabulary acquisition has become a critical criterion for the Chinese English Majors. Since vocabulary serves as a basic constructing element in English learning. Mind-Mapping, a technique to organize and express knowledge visually and hierarchically might be a new strategy for the students to enlarge their vocabulary size. While the corpus-based data driven learning approach provides a new way of learning vocabulary in a more authentic environment with large quantity of examples, which is an effective way for the students to deepen their word knowledge. This paper attempts to demonstrate that with the strategy of combing Mind-Mapping with corpus-based data driven learning, the English Majors can be more effective in their vocabulary learning.
