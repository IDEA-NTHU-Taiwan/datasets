In China, with the reform process of higher education system, the turnover phenomenon of university teachers gets more popular. Though the absolute turnover rate is not very high, such an emerging issue has already put much pressure on Chinese universities. However, besides limited literature, there are very limited studies focusing on the issue of university teachers' turnover, and what's more, the existing research contributions are far from being satisfied. In order to deal with the gap, the paper proposes a four-phased turnover model for Chinese university teachers adapted from Mobley turnover procedure model. According to the model, the whole turnover process of Chinese university teachers can be divided into four phases, respectively the job sense accumulation phase, the job burnout breeding phase, the turnover intention emergence phase and the turnover behaviour execution phase. In each phase, Chinese university teachers have different psychological features and typical behaviour, and the transformation from the former phase to the late depends on some special conditions.
