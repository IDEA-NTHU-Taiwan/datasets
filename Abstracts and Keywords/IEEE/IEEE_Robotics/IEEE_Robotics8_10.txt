The high occurrence rate of the cardiovascular diseases and the development of proteomics bring the cardio-muscle proteomics. All have already opened a related research one after another at home and abroad currently, but almost of these focuses on the cardiovascular disease, few on sports science. According to the importance of heat in sports, applying cardio-muscle proteomics on sports science is very significant, because it can study the influence of exercise stimulation imposing on cardio muscle proteome during the whole process. According to the present condition, sum up all the known myocardial proteins and give them a classification, sum up the study of myocardial proteins in sports science, sum up and the main problems of the methods and protocols of cardio-muscle proteomics, and put forward the research and the applied foreground of cardio-muscle proteomics in sports science, to provide a reference for workers to study cardio-muscle proteome.
