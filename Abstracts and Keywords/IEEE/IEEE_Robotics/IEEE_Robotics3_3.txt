CLP Power supplies electricity to customers in Kowloon, the New Territories, Lantau and most of the outlying islands of Hong Kong. Like other power systems in the world, supply voltage dips are unavoidable and most of the voltage dips in Hong Kong are caused by natural and external interferences. In some cases, a voltage dip could lead to equipment tripping in a residential building, for example, corridor lamps, water pumps, supply distribution boards, escalators and lifts. They may cause mild impact to tenants but some could result in safety issues like searching in darkness or losing balance under sudden stoppage of escalators. Property management views that all equipment tripping incidents are significant as any of the tripping could degrade their service level. Immediate dispatch of emergency teams to mitigate the concerns is thus necessary.
