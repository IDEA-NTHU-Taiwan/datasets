To help enterprises in China obtain more competition advantage by relying on the effective management mode, the Supply and Demand Network with multifunction and opening characteristics for enterprises (abbr. SDN) as a new management mode is proposed. As a result, the research on traditional enterprises transformed into SDN enterprises is being carried on. To assist enterprises to launch this transformation smoothly, firstly, in view of supply and demand activities, the difference between traditional enterprises and SDN enterprises are analyzed emphatically.
