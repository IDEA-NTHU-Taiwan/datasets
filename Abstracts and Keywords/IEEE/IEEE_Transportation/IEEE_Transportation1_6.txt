Economic or social crisis frequently occurs in the same way as tempests occur in nature. Nature is evolving in a set fashion despite sudden and dramatic changes. The integrated traffic system sometimes experiences a balanced period, and sometimes suffers crisis induced by economic or social systems. It is expected that the integrated traffic system will evolve in a beneficial way. The paper would break provisionally away from the present theory in traffic and transportation. In line with Biologys general principles (for example, evolution by natural selection, power law, etc.), a long and robust development model for a Regional Freight Transportation Network (RFTN) that can cope with the financial crisis is put forward. The RFTN of Chinas highways is selected as a demonstration. A significant conclusion appears: to RFTN, collocating resource reasonably between exploiting market and expanding self-capacity is pivotal. The increase of freight volume on the RFTN depends heavily on the network infrastructure.
