Simulation is a proven aid to vehicle specification and design optimisation. Zytek Automotive Ltd has developed an in-house multi-application modelling system for feasibility, proof of concept and desktop design optimisation of ICE, hybrid and pure electric vehicles. Model components contain a mix of simple physics such as energy conservation and vehicle dynamic behaviour, and empirical or component specification data. Components can interchangeably be specified at varying levels of complexity allowing modelled emphasis to be tailored to the target application. The model differs from commercially available alternatives in that it is driver based and incorporates feedback PID control of the vehicle's driver input sensor set. Driver interaction and the effects of driver behaviour on vehicle performance are simulated. Applications include fuel economy predictions for HEV programmes, EV range evaluation, control strategy design, evaluation and calibration optimisation, and the simulation of real world driving conditions. This paper provides a detailed overview of the model including its generic library based construction in the Matlab Simulink modelling environment. Application of the model to conventional ICE, HEV and EV vehicles is demonstrated. Model capabilities and limitations are discussed.
