For the sake of deepening the understanding of speculative knowledge and increasing hand-on ability, the quality of practice teaching must be taken into account. Practical teaching is an important progress of training talent in engineering colleges and it is the key point whether the aim of training higher educated and practical talents will be realized or not. Through the relation of practical training and teaching arrangement of Ultrasonic Testing is discussed, we find the best combination between them. The paper will be based on the engineering education model &#x201C;learning by doing&#x201D;. Thus, the capability of students increases in the knowledge application and practice, and improves teaching quality.
