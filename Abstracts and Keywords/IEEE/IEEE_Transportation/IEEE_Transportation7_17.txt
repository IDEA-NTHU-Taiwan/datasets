Corporation information systems estimate is the key as well as thorny point of the research on information systems. As corporation information systems are complicated social technological systems, the estimate of them is a complicated social process. The multiple subjects, multiple stages and multiple levels of corporation information systems estimate decide the complexity in evaluating them. The complexity in evaluating corporation information system is analyzed in detail in the paper in a bid to provide a basic research frame for comprehensive estimate of corporation information systems.
