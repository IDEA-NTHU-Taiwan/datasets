Mineral processing is one of the most energy intensive industrial operations with important direct emissions given by the Diesel fuel used in mining equipment like haul trucks for mineral transportation and indirect emissions generated by the use of electrical energy in grinding mills, slurry pumps and high-current rectifiers. Therefore, there is a challenge for improving the efficiency of energy use, the abatement of carbon emissions, the use of water and environment care. Other challenges are given by the environment around the mining operations, with altitudes above 3000 meters above sea level, mountain conditions, as well as, the growing problems stated by lower ore-grades, deeper mine pits and longer tunnels, requiring systems with higher transport and beneficiation capacity. For economy of scale, high-power drives and modern technologies are needed. This work reviews the trend of technology and potentials for carbon emission abatement and energy efficiency in mineral processing.
