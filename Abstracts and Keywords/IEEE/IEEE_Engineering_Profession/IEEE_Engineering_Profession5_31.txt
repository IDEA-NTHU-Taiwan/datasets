This research aims at taking a further step in developing a methodology framework of innovation performance audit. With adopting the ideology of performance measurement system, a framework of key performance indicator(KPI) system including three level issues of `what is input', `what is done' and `what happens' is designed for technological innovation audit, which can reflect the performance of technological innovation at firm's level comprehensively. Furthermore, a questionnaire survey on line is conducted to test the validity of the key performance indicator system. Based on data analysis, the KPI system is proved to be effective as a whole, of which most indicators not only are important, but also could be measured easily in firms. Finally, in-depth innovation performance audit of four hi-tech firms is taken as a case study to verify the validity of the KPI system.
