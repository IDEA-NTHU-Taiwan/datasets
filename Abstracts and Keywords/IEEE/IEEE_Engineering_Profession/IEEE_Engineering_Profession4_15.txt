This paper will depict ICAS - Integration, Competency-based, Acumen and Soft Skills Technical Training Programs and how it cultivates an all rounded engineering community. The ultimate goal of ICAS is to put engineers through the technical leadership pipeline. The 'Integration Program' consists of new hire and graduate trainee boot camps, which are organizational specific and aligned towards the relevant project/product. The program consumes 3 months and produced very positive evaluation results: 93% application of training for work. 'Competency-based Program' continues engineers' development targeted towards Exempt level engineers. A structured, sustainable and comprehensive curricula based on the site's top 12 competency areas was developed covering more than 186 courses in depth &amp; breadth, which are 100% available. The 'Technical Acumen Program' is for senior technical contributors: consists of talks, sharing and tutorials on roadmaps and advancements of Intel and industry technology - to provide technical employees the alignment towards Intel's technology as well as understand Intel's end-user needs. 'Technical Soft Skills Program' focuses on the soft skill portion of engineering work to complete the balanced development.
