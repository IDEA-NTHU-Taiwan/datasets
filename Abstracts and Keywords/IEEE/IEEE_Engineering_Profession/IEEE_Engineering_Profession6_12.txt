Nanocomposite technology trajectories have been characterized by various concepts and methodologies in order to obtain a picture of how technological innovation takes place and proceeds in Taiwan. Patent analysis used for obtaining technology trajectories and Delphi survey which allows technology trajectories to be linked to future industrial scenario are combined together in this study in order to approach nanocomposite development blue print for Taiwan. The results show that Taiwanpsilas nanocomposite patents mainly focus on nanocomposite material with polymeric matrix and function of mechanical/dimensional stability. Two critical ways to promote Taiwanpsilas nanocomposite technology are through self-R&amp;D of related techniques and expanding market and economies of scale, also Taiwan is expected to develop its own technologies which allow its industries to be transferred to a more innovative environment.
