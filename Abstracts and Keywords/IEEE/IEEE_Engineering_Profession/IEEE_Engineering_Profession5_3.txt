Curriculum planning, teaching delivery, and technology tools can synergistically work together to produce a program that will engage, excite, and retain students. Through use of these techniques plus other factors presented in the workshop, the presenters' program has experienced significant improvement in student retention and student enrollment growth, well above the national norm.
