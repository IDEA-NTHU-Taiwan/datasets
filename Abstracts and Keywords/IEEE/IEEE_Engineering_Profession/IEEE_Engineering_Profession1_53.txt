This paper describes the approach taken to, and the design and evaluation of a low cost, tailorable, polysensory environment for children with an Autistic Spectrum Disorder in mainstream schools. The results of the qualitative evaluation, undertaken over a six week period, show benefits in terms of the communication and engagement of the children. The implications of these are described in terms of the wider need for tailorable environments, teaching and learning experiences to enable all children to achieve their full potential.
