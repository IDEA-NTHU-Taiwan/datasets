The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of relational capital and causal ambiguity on knowledge transfer performance. Regress analysis was used to test the hypotheses in a sample of 97 observations of Taiwanese firms. The findings suggest that firms would achieve a higher degree of knowledge transfer performance if they build up a better relation capital with their partners and if there is less causal ambiguity in the knowledge transfer process. Further, the effect of relational capital on knowledge transfer performance is positively moderated by uncertain imitability. Managerial implications and future research directions are discussed..
