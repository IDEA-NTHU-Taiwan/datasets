This study explores the composed elements of a sense of belonging and the consequences of this sense when using technology in the setting of a community-based organization. Previous research on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has indicated that a user's actual behavior in technology use is determined by perceived constructs of technology features, such as usefulness and ease of use. However, based on the interpersonal connection perspective, a person's behavioral intention of technology use can also be influenced by user-perceived acceptance of a group within an organization. The purpose of our research is to clarify the specific role and function of a sense of belonging as well as to explore its potential composed elements and effects on technology use. Our research is based on longitudinal data collected from 107 cabbies in the largest taxi fleet using the Global Positioning System (GPS) dispatching network in Taipei over three time periods. Results of a confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation modeling (SEM) show that the sense of belonging comprises two elements: psychological ownership and organizational identity. Furthermore, results of a path analysis using SEM show that the individual's attitude towards technology use is influenced by the sense of belonging, which in turn affects a person's acceptance of actual technology. This paper concludes with theoretical and practical implications.
