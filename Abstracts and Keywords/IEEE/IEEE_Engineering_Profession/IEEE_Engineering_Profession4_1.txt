We examined the role of knowledge management capacity in the relationship between creativity mechanism and innovation performance. Regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses in a sample of 94 firms. The results indicate that creativity mechanisms are positively related to knowledge management capacity which, in turn, has a positive effect on innovation performance. Our results provide evidence that knowledge management capacity plays a mediating role between creativity mechanism and innovation performance. Managerial implications and future research directions are discussed.
