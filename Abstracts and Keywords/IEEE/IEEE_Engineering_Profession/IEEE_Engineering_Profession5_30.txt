Aiming at the conflicts that exist between task design and execution, this paper introduced an important contextual factor: Â¿temporal framing effectÂ¿ to build a new type of conflict management mechanism for knowledge worker team. A new perspective on conflict management research is provided. By constructing a conceptive theory model: Â¿temporal framing effect - conflict between task design and execution - knowledge worker team performanceÂ¿, this paper developed a new logical thought and theoretical tool for conflict management research in order to pursue effective management patterns in managing conflicts between task design and execution in knowledge worker team.
