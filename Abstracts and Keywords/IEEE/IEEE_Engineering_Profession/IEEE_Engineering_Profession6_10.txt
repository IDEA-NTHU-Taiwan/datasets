This paper reports on a case study on SF practices of Deutsche Telekom AG (DTAG). The foresight system of DTAG includes continuous scanning and issue-driven foresight activities. These SF activities generate value for DTAG in terms of reduction of uncertainty and the exploration of new business fields.
