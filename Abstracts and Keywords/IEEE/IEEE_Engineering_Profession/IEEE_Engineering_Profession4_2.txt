Companies are looking for Technology Foresight (TF) models to focus strategy and innovation management. This paper establishes an ldquoimplementationrdquo gap in TF practices based on empirical research in multinational companies in Europe and Japan. The ldquoimplementationrdquo gap refers to the neglected use of TF results in strategy and innovation management. Thus the paper suggests a TF model focusing on guiding ideas for a structured approach to eliminate this ldquoimplementationrdquo gap. Concepts of ldquobackcastingrdquo, ldquofunctionalitiesrdquo and ldquobottleneck technologiesrdquo are introduced to set priorities in the foresight process.
