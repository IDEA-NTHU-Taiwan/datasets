The Indirect current mode control is applied in the Phase-Shifted Series Resonant Converter System (PSRC). The current is generated from resonant tank vector and the resonant current is regulated indirectly through quasi-current mode control and thus the dynamic performance of the converter system is improved. Only single voltage feedback is required for the system. The proposed system consists of two control loops with one inner resonant vector and one outer voltage loop. H-bridge system used in high power DC-DC conversion is a popular and well-received method in many applications. The basic H-bridge converter can be modified easily by introducing soft-switching to the converters. Some more advanced control strategies were developed recently to improve the performance of control system but they depend on the accuracy of the plant model or much more complicated computation is required. The control methods in the past have been reported in using the adaptive control such as auto-disturbance &#x2014; rejection control (ADRC) and passivity-based control. The method is similar to the d and q current control for multilevel converter but the present method is based on the control using resonant component phasor. The PSRC system based on quasi current mode control was implemented as well as the conventional version in order to compare their performances under the same conditions. PI controllers were employed as the controller for both the systems and their parameters were chosen via experiments to achieve better dynamic responses near rated load. The simulation and the real time experiment are carried out the result show the better performance of conventional controller when compared with that of open loop system.
