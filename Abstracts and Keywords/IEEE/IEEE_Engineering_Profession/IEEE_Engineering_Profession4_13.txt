When transitioning traditional classroom courses to an on-line teaching environment, there are a variety of ways to accomplish the task. One approach is to combine classroom and on-line activities, by migrating a significant portion of the course material to an on-line environment while maintaining the remaining material in a more traditional classroom setting. This scenario requires the class to meet in the same physical location only half as often, while affording students the opportunity to complete the remaining on-line material on their own schedule. A second approach is to move all lecture materials into an on-line environment, while maintaining only the class meetings that were reserved for presentations and class discussions. Again, this frees up classroom space as well as allowing students freedom to schedule their individual assignments and team project time more efficiently. A third approach is the complete migration of a semester of traditional material to a virtual classroom, where the students and teacher never meet face to face. This discussion will compare identical sections of the same class, one traditional and one on-line, being conducted by the same instructor, using the same material.
