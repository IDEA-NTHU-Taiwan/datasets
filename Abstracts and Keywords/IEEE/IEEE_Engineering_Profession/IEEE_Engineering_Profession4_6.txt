Just as psychological profiles give us an idea on the type of personality of an individual; it can be argued that a philosophical profile can provide similar access to the embedded values of individuals; to delve more into their biases, assumptions and predispositions. Most attempts to define an individual and the way he/she sees reality and the way he/she seeks knowledge has been done through cognitive studies and rarely through different realms of philosophy, such as ontology and epistemology, which in such cases, have been analyzed separately. This paper presents a philosophical profile that considers ontology, epistemology and teleology to create a framework for assessing the individual philosophical perspective. This framework can be used to establish predispositions and possible ways an individual can choose to address problems.
