The PAVEs Program (Profesores Asociados Vinculados a Empresa - Adjunct Enterprise Professors) of the University of Valladolid allows enterprises to offer a set of optional subjects dealing with the technological knowledge necessary for their operation. These subjects are not only very attractive for the students, as they are given the chance to get an insight of the world that will host them as employees in the future, but also could be studied to extract lessons about the future European Higher Education Area (EHEA). This work presents the PAVEs program, the lessons learned that could be applied to the plan adaptation to the EHEA, and how the PAVEs subjects could be better integrated with ordinary subjects in the upcoming EHEA.
