It is well accepted that a solid background in the appropriate math and science classes prior to college is a key to success in pursuing careers in Engineering and Technology (E &amp; T). Pre-engineering courses for K-12 students have repeatedly shown that they can help improve the skill level, and self-confidence of students as they enter the university E &amp; T environment. This paper will examine student attitude and skill level as it related to the background knowledge and self confidence that students had during a three year summer pre-engineering camp conducted for urban high school students.
