Isotropic conductive adhesives (ICAs) with lower bonding temperature, higher resolution and environmental friendly have been used extensively in packaging process. In order to improve the electrical and thermal conductive properties of ICAs, two kinds of bimodal high temperature stable ICAs with matrix SHT6 and fillers with composition of macro silver flakes and boron nitride nanoparticles or macro silver flakes and silicon carbide nanoparticles were studied. In these two kinds of adhesives, the silver flakes were 75wt%, and the contents of nanoparticles were 0wt%, 0.5wt%, 1.5wt%, 2.5wt%, 3wt%, 5wt% in weight. All the samples were cured at 150Â°C for 1 hour. SEM images and EDS results show the nanoparticles disperse randomly in the ICA. The electrical resistivity of these ICAs depends on the contents of silver flakes and is hardly affected by BN nanoparticles and SiC nanoparticles. The thermal conductivity of these ICAs increases firstly with the weight increase of the BN nanoparticles and SiC nanoparticles. And then it decreases when the content of the nanoparticles beyond a certain point.
