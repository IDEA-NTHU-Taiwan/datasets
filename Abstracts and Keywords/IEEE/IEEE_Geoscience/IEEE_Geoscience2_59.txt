A novel data acquisition and analysis system has been developed for a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) bioanalyzer, which is based on the use of TSPR1k23 biosensor and composed of a microflow cell, a clamp, and a photoelectronic conversion device. A virtual instrument consists of a computer-based platform that is equipped with powerful application software and cost-effective hardware, which outperform the functions of the instrument for obtaining data from the biosensor. In this system, The PIC24HJ32GP302 microprocessor interfacing with a 16bit ADS8326 analog-to-digital converter is used to transform the photoelectronic signals from the CCD photodetector and the communication between the microprocessor and the computer is achieved through the USB-RS232C serial port converter adapter designed by CP2102 chip. The system software for describing the biomolecular interaction and sample concentration is programmed with LabVIEW graphic programming environment, which be mainly introduced in this paper. The software modules reveal important information for sensor golden surface that SPR signal can be identified as well and the values of response unit (RU), refractive index (RI) and sample concentration can be computed correspondingly. Because it is based on computer, the system's function is flexibly defined and meets user's requirement easily. This data acquisition and analysis system is more directviewing, economical, high efficient, friendly in comparison with other data acquisition and analysis system based on VB language or assemble language. Some biochemistry experimental results show that it is a highly performance data acquisition and analysis system.
