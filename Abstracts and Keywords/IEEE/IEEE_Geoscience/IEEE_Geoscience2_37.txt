With the development of university education and the evolution of the characteristics of the requirement to engineering graduates with high quality from entire society, the engineering education in University and college is concerned extensively and deeply by researchers of academic institutes and executives from enterprises at present. Based on the perspective of knowledge management in high school educating, the author inspected the process of knowledge transferring in todaypsilas university engineering education. The analysis was focused on the processes of knowledge transmission and studentspsila knowledge acquisition, which are opposed and inter depended to each other at the same time, the typical imperfections in the process of knowledge transfer but always been neglected in todaypsilas university engineering education were identified, and some responding measures were proposed, which is based on the authorpsilas long term teaching practice.
