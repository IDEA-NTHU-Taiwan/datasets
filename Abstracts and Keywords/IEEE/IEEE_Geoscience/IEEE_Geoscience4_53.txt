In order to research the change and distribution characters of heavy metals in the sediment of estuary, sediment grain size, Acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and simultaneously extracted metals(SEM, including Fe, Mn, Sr, Ba, Cr, V, and Co) were analyzed in three sediment short column cores collected form Licun estuary of Jiaozhou Bay. The sediment near the estuary is relative coarse (silty sand) compare with the sediment in other two cores (sandy silt). Research area is an obvious sulfur-rich environment since the AVS content in sediment samples is high. Content of heavy metals in form of SEM present in an order as Fe&gt;Mn&gt;Sr&gt;Ba&gt;Cr&gt;V&gt;Co. SEM content of sediment is controlled by grain size obviously. SEM-Mn, V, Co have trend of distribution from sediment to bottom sea water in JZB'3 and JZB'4. Generally high correlations among different species of SEM-Fe, Mn, Cr, V, Co indicate those SEM species have similar source or geochemical behavior in early diagenesis processes.
