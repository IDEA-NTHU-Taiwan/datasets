The migration and transformation of agricultural non-point source pollutants in drainage ditches is an important step of agricultural non-point source pollution control and management. On the bases of analyses on the ecological structure of drainage ditches and purification mechanism of ditch wetland to agricultural non-point pollutants, experiment was conducted taking the XI YU drainage ditch system, in the Qing-Tong-Xia Irrigation District at the Yellow River upstream, as an example. The results show that ditch wetland has better purifying effect to agricultural non-point pollutants, of which, the purification rate of total phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen were 27.46% and 21.80% respectively. According to the current research situation, the further research object includes three aspects, quantitative study on different action of each component in drainage ditch ecosystem, migration model of agricultural non-point source pollutants in drainage ditch and the relationship between ditch wetland application and regional eco-environment at the macro level.
