A new index is developed for evaluating the contribution of ICT services to the realization of a sustainability society. This new index, named the gross social feel-good (GSF) index", allows us to evaluate both the positive and negative effects of ICT services in terms of their environmental, social and economic influences. In addition, the GSF index includes a happiness index that indicates people's feelings with ICT services. We proposed a method for evaluating the happiness index that is based on the results of questionnaires about the necessity, usability and impression of ICT services.
