As the idea of carbon capture and storage (CCS) has rapidly evolved from a relatively obscure concept to an increasingly recognized potential climate change mitigation approach that could contribute to stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations, environmental advocacy groups have been engaged in a limited, but growing, capacity in public discussions related to carbon storage. Given the critical role that environmental advocacy groups play in shaping public perceptions of different potential approaches to solving environmental problems and given the recognition that public perception of CCS will influence its advancement, this paper reviews the perspectives and positions of several prominent environmental advocacy groups related to CCS. While several environmental organizations have taken strong positions in favor of biological carbon storage and against the idea of oceanic carbon storage, most environmental groups have been cautiously hesitant in their public stance and assessment of the more advanced concept of injecting captured CO<sub>2</sub> underground into natural geologic reservoirs. Concerns that CCS may detract from efforts and funds to support increased use of other existing energy technology alternatives as well as apprehension about ill-defined risks and impacts associated with storing CO<sub>2</sub> underground have contributed to the hesitancy to support CCS.
