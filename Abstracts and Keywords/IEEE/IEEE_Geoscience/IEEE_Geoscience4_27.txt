In a wide urban area, if the atmospheric circulation is absent or very feeble, air fluxes are driven by the thermal conditions, mainly due to diurnal heating. The warmer area surrounding the centre of the town, the urban heat island, has been studied for Milano, Italy. Taking into account the kind of results obtained, some criteria are suggested to evaluate from a climatological and energetic point of view the interrelation between the heat island and a significant presence of photovoltaic panels installed to produce electrical energy.
