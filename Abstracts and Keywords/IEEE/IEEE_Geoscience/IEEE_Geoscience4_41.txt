GML (geography mark-up language) has been adopted by ISO as standard for the transport and storage of geographic information, and it has been generally recognized by GIS researchers owing to its obvious advantages in these fields. However, most studies about GML are concentrated on its data description, exchange and representation etc. As GML is used in GIS application systems complexly and extensively, and related software tools and products are developed more and more, interoperation between GML applications technologies are becoming an outstanding obstacle that restricts their developments. As to the same application such as GML parsing, different users or GIS software can describe it differently when transferring their applications request through the web, which will result in semantic discrepancy and obstacle GML application technologies to share.Based on the previous work, this paper will analyze the problems of GML parsing, and propose GML Parsing Technology Service (GPTS) on precondition of full studies on GML parsing referring to OGC specification implementation related to GML. In web server, service requests are generated from fragments by parsing module, which will invoke the specified interfaces from GML Parsing Processing Server (GPPS). Applying related services to the requests, the parsing result will return to clients. Via the GPTS, various clients will conform to certain convenient rules when posting their parsing requests, so one target will request XML files to parse GML geodata from different sources by invoking the same operations on geographic features and elements. The experiment results which are carried out by different clients in this paper demonstrate GPTS's feasibility, availability and rationality. This research on GPTS will provide an interoperable parsing way on the web to eliminate obstacles between GML parsing application technologies sharing and interoperability.
