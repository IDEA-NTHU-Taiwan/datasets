This article criticises the Hardin's argument and proposes the other view that a community can solve their common property sustainability. Commons or resources can be useful but sometimes could be dangerous for human and its environment. The resources can be vulnerable if the human who have to manage fail. This argument is a basic of Hardin's view. Hardin argues every people only pay attention on their needs or their private property and they do not care with other stakeholders. As a result, human always fail to manage the resources and also the Hardin's view does not deal with the community rule. Hardin only proposes that the government rule is an appropriate way to maintain the commons. The failure of government policies and private interest is quite common in the world so this essay argues that community itself can manage the sustainable resources and reduce the tragedy of commons.
