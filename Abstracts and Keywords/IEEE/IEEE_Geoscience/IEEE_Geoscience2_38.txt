Extant literatures studied the influences of national culture on the perceptions of tourist destination image (TDI), while few researches focused on the different TDI multidimensionality induced by national culture. This study examines the influence of national culture on the multidimensionality of TDI via taking tourist nationality as the proxy variable of national culture for two samples composed of Japan and Korea tourist respectively. The result shows that there are evident structural differences of TDI multidimensionality for the two samples. Specifically, the numbers, the eigen values and the item composition of TDI factors, and the influences of TDI factors on tourist satisfaction or behavioral intentions all are quite different. Finally, managerial implications are discussed.
