Both chicken feces and vinasses were abundant in the suburb and countries in China, they were rich in N resource and organic carbon resource respectively. In order to investigate disciplinary about the effect of temperature on the protein mass concentration, chicken feces was pretreated with 10ml condensed sulphate for 30min to eliminate the harmful microbes, the mixture of feces and vinasses was anerobically fermented under different temperature. It was found that, both cross protein mass concentration and real protein concentration increased with the temperature, and the relative improvement ratio of real protein increased quicker with temperature than that of cross protein, and the latter showed a linear fit.
