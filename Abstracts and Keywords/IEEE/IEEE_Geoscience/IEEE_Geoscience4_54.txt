Three steps chemical extraction method is applied to quantificationally analyze the reactive iron contents and pyrite contents in the sediments of NH-1 core from northern continental slope of South China Sea. Reactive iron content is 132~199&#x03BC;mol/g with an average value of 158.9&#x03BC;mol/g, and pyrite content is 14.3 ~ 147.6&#x03BC;mol/g with an average value of 84.82&#x03BC;mol/g. The pyrite content changes in a relative large range and has an increasing tendency with depth increasing. The pyrite content got from the method of chemical extraction is more approach to the true value of pyrite content in the sediment than the method of selection with microscope. The pyrite content got from the method of selection with microscope can represent the coarse pyrite mineral grain content. The relativity of two sets of data got from two methods is negative and it reflects the sulfur recycle abnormity caused by high flux of methane in the sediment. The relativity between pyrite content and &#x03B4;<sup>34</sup>S of pyrite is analyzed and indicate that the pyrite is mainly origin from the sulfate reduction of organic material and from the sulfate reduction of methane in a certain extent. It has the possibility of nature gas hydrate existence in the underlying formation. The restriction factors of pyrite formation in the sediment of NH-1 core are redox condition, organic material content, methane diffused from deep formation, and the sulfate supply in some cases.
