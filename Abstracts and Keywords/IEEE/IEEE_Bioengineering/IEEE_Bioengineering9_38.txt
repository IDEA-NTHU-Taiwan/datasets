Peter Checkland and his colleagues developed Soft System Methodology (SSM) (associated with the department of systems at Lancaster University in UK) with the intention to fetch an organized technique towards the explanation of imprecise management-type problems. The rationale of a rich picture is to help out the analyst to gain a deep insight of the complex problem situations. The paper opted for a case study in which the rich pictures are compared with other tools and techniques. The research will disclose facts about the effectiveness of rich pictures in organizations to solve problem. It will also help to investigate that by using symbols and diagrammatic conventions which are used to signify any messy situation must be unambiguous and understandable by the users can fill in the gaps of understanding problem first and its better solution. This paper includes the implications for the implementation and incorporation of rich pictures in order to get optimal solutions in time.
