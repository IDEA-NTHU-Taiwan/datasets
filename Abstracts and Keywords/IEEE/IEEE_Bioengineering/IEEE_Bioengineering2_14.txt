The Saudi private health organisations are becoming increasingly reliant on the efficient use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in providing quality healthcare services and achieving goals. Deployment of ICT in these organisations is mostly targeted at administrative, managerial decision-making and sometimes, clinical applications. One of the key barriers to realising the maximisation of ICT benefits in these organisations has been identified as the adoption of imported modelling approaches in managing these technologies, which in most cases fall short of dealing with existing issues or meeting indigenous needs. This paper identifies key issues related to ICT management and develops a modelling approach, suitable for this particular area and environment, which can be used to enhance the implementation of health informatics/health information systems (HI/HIS) in these organisations. The model is based on a literature review as well as a field research study of current HI management through interviews, questionnaires and document review, and considers major issues, which contribute to the limited success of these systems. The model is evaluated and tested to examine its applicability, practicability, potential fit as well as a precursor to HI integration and development in the Saudi health environment. Empirical results are analysed and tabulated with suggestions for more appropriate approaches to HI implementation, in developing countries as a whole, and the Saudi health environment in particular.
