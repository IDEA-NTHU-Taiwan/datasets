This paper aims to contribute to the design of decision support for the physical access security systems. We address the problem of extracting information helpful for early detection of physiological and psycho-emotional data linked to situational awareness. Face images in visible and infrared bands acquired by the system constitute the input of the module for hyper-spectral face analysis and synthesis. The corresponding 3D models, one for video images and one for infrared, are generated by fitting the generic model onto images. The texture maps representing the hemoglobin and melanin content of the facial skin, as well as the temperature distribution, constitutes the output of the face analysis and modeling module. This information is used for evaluating the physiological and psycho-emotional states of a person.
