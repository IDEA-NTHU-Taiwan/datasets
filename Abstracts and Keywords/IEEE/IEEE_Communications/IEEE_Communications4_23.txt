The difference frequency generation arising by mixing of two near-infrared modes in a GaAs based butt-joint diode laser with germanium substrate are studied theoretically. It is shown that the power of the difference mode in the 5 - 50 THz range generated by 1-W near-infrared modes in a 100-mum-wide laser at room temperature can be 40 muW.
