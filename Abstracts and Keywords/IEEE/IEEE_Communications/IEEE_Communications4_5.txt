This paper is based on the theme `Virtual Worlds for Academic, Organizational, and Life-Long Learning'. It reports the implications on informal learning through a research that uses 3D digital simulations of proposed streetscape design schemes for the main boulevard of Putrajaya, Malaysia. The exercise was in consideration of the organizational focus of Putrajaya, the new administrative capital of Malaysia, to utilize electronic governance in its day-to-day operation. Besides gauging the public's receptivity to the design proposals and digital approach, consulting the public using the digital simulations in a participative design spirit is interpreted as a potential aspect of e-governance. The paper looks at the ramifications on communication and acquisition of new knowledge for the public and the students-researchers primarily and the city authority secondarily. The insights will highlight aspects to consider in implementing this process of digital-based participative design in the future.
