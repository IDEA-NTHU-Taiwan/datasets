Automotive infotainment systems were getting more and more features in recent years. The usability of their HMIs (human-machine interfaces) has been improved considerably. However the complexity of the HMI software is growing. Testing the HMI became very demanding and time consuming. Because of multiplicity of HMI variants, a better code coverage is a goal for the development process of most manufacturers. Model-based testing is one way to achieve a better code coverage and keep the costs and complexity acceptable. However, the existing research approaches in the area of model-based HMI testing can not satisfy the needs for our testing purposes. In the work a model-based testing approach will be proposed for testing both the logical behavior and the graphical interface of the automotive infotainment HMI. As an important part of the testing approach a test-oriented HMI specification model will be designed. It is a model, which describes the required behavior of the HMI and contains the necessary information for the testing process. Test generation methods and the design of tests will also be proposed. These results can be generally used for testing advanced GUI-driven applications. Specific coverage criteria for infotainment HMIs, methods for automatic test generation and verification of the system behavior are also focuses of the work. The paper introduces the ideas and the goals of our model-based testing approach for infotainment HMIs.
