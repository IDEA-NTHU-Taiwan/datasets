 This paper introduces the iSith metaphor, a concept for a very direct bimanual object selection and manipulation interface using two ray pointers, one for each hand, and thus taking advantage of the user&#146;s natural control over his interhand-coordination. The concept allows controlled translation of virtual objects in an increased interaction volume, not restricted by arm&#146;s length and without the use of buttons for reeling or confusing algorithms for translation scaling.
