It highly deserves to remove human operators from hazardous environments or monotony routine work during pick-and-place type operation in current industrial societies; it also deserves to encourage the work in new exploration without risks on humans or objects. In order to achieve this, a novel robotic gripper is presented in this paper. A gripper is designed to grasp unknown objects with different masses, shapes, and coefficients of frictions considering simplicity, durability and economy. The grasping process during object lifting is considered mainly based on the slip reflex principle, as applying insufficient force leads to object slipping, and dropping may occur. A new fuzzy control algorithm based on empirical investigation of the human hand skills is proposed to adjust the applied force on the object without the risk of object crushing or dropping. In the mean time, the controller is designed to maintain the object slip in reasonable limit. The gripper design and new developed scenario force control resulted in the fast response of the task achievement. Input/output system variables are measured and analyzed. Experimental work is presented to demonstrate the efficiency and high performance of the introduced robotic gripper.
