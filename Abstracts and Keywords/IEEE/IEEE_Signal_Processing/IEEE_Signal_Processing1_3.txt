We present an optical setup which makes use of a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) in order to electronically control the modification of the reference wave in Digital Lensless Fourier Holography. The SLM provides the advantage of avoiding any mechanical adjustments in order to adapt the reference wave to different object positions. A rule for the complex transmittance required to be generated by the SLM is presented and experimental results prove the big potential of the configuration in regards to Digital Holography.
