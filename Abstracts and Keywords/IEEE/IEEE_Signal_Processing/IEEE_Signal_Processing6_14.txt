Electrovestibulography (EvestG), a technique used to measure neuronal activity of the vestibular apparatus and nuclei, has been used. We hypothesise that a novel wavelet based signal processing technique, a Neural Event Extraction Routine can be used to extract new diagnostically meaningful biomarkers from EVestG recordings obtained from Meniere's patients. This paper shows the EVestG has the potential to separate Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo and Meniere's Disease using a "DC" Biomarker. This "DC" component in the EVestG response appears to correspond to cupula displacement and consequently a threshold shift in the unfiltered EVestG response.
