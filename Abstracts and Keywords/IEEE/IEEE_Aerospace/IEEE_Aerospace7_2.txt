Multi-state microwave devices such as digitally controlled phase shifters, attenuators and transmit receive modules must be tested in a great number of different device states. This causes the test time of these devices to be a significant part of their production cost. This paper presents the test time reductions that may be achieved through the use of a high speed microwave receiver instead of the conventional network analyzer.
