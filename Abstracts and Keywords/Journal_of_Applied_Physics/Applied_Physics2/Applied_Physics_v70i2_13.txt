It is shown that the recent theory of photothermal phenomena in semiconductor pn junctions by Mandelis is incorrect because it ignores the heat generated by the photocurrent passing the junction barrier (the Peltier heat). The relative contribution of heat sources caused by the current and by carrier recombination to the total heating is discussed for open circuit and short circuit regimes.
