The spin pinning in the oxide surface layer has been observed directly, and it is considered a possible reason why the oxide layer leads to the decrease of the specific saturation magnetization for fine iron particles. The pinning depth has been estimated by means of a Mössbauer effect under an applied field of 6 T in a thermalcycle process. The Debye temperature of the oxide layer and the temperature dependence of f2/f1 have been obtained, where f1 and f2 are the Mössbauer recoilless fractions for the inner ±Fe core and the oxide layer, respectively. Furthermore, the estimation for the thickness of an oxide layer has been improved.
