GaAsAlxGa1xAs heterostructures were irradiated with 6MeV protons at low temperature to study systematically the influence of lattice disorder in twodimensional electron systems on resistivity, mobility, carrier concentration n, and quantum Halleffect structures. The additional irradiationinduced scattering centers lead to a linear decrease of n with the proton fluence and to a broadening of the quantum Hall plateaus, which is qualitatively explained in the framework of localization in magnetic fields.
