Spectroscopic ellipsometry has been used for determining optical direct interband transitions in a set of AlxIn1xAs and AlxGa1xP alloys. From these experimental results, the dependence of the E0 and E1 transitions is established as a function of the Al composition and the bowing parameters are obtained.
