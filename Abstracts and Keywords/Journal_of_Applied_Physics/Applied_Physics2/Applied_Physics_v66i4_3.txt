Electrical and magnetic properties of the superconducting oxides with nominal composition (Bi0.7 Pb0.3 )2Sr2Ca2 Cu3 Ox prepared from polymeric precursors have been investigated. Superconducting transition with zeroresistance temperature at T=108 K was achieved for a sample sintered at 840	°C under a low oxygen pressure. The critical current density at 77 K in a zero magnetic field is <400 A/cm2 , which is much higher than that of the Pbfree sample. Variations of the superconducting transition temperature, the critical current density, and magnetic properties with heat treatment time are discussed in connection with the structural properties.
