We have studied methods of varying the ion species generated by a lithiumfluoride overcoated anode in a 0.5MV magnetically insulated ion diode. We found that cleaning the anode surface with a 13.6MHz rf glow discharge or illuminating the anode with a pulsed soft xray, vacuumultraviolet (XUV) radiation source just before the accelerator pulse significantly altered the ion species of the ion beam produced by the diode. The glowdischarge plasma removed adsorbates (carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen) from the surface of the LiF flashover source. The ions seen were lithium and hydrogen. Unfortunately, the diode impedance with a lithiumfluoride anode was high and the ion efficiency was low; however, XUV irradiation of the surface dramatically lowered the impedance by desorbing neutrals from the ion source via photonstimulated desorption. Current densities of ten times the ChildLangmuir spacecharge limit were achieved under XUV irradiation. In particular, ion currents increased by over a factor of 3 when 12 mJ/cm2 of XUV radiation was used. However, with XUV irradiation the largest fraction of ions were fluorine, oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen, not lithium.
