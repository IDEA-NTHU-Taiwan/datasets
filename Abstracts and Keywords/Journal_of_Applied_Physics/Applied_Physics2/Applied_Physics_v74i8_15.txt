Preparation, xray diffraction, and ac susceptibility measurements of Y1xCaxSr2Cu2.67Ti0.33O6+z are presented. Tc increases from 18 K for x=0 to 22 K for x=0.1 and then decreases to 18.5 K for x=0.15. The irreversibility line derived from the susceptibility data indicates an enhancement of x=0.05.
