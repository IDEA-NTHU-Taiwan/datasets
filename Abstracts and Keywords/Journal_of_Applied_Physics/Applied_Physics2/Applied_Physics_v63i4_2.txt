Heimplanted samples of LiNbO3 have been analyzed by 24MeV 28Si elastic recoil detection. For 50keV He implants, the Li and H profiles show a depletion of Li from the sample nearsurface region which coincides with a gain of H. The Li loss is seen to increase with increasing ion fluence and implantation temperature.
