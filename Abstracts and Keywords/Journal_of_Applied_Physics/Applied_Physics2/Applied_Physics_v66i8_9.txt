The indentationinduced cracks in brittle coating/substrate systems are examined. The crack paths induced by indentation with different applied loads are exploited by a postbending test. Sandwiched bending bars are designed to conduct this postbending test. The influence of the mechanical properties of each component and the interface and the thickness of coating on the paths of the indentation cracks are addressed.
