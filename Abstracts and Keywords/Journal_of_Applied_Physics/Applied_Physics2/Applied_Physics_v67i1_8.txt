We introduce a new technique to modify the coherence properties and the farfield intensity distributions of optical fields. Use is made of a combination of Bragg diffraction and RamanNath diffraction in an acoustooptic deflector. The highfrequency Bragg grating in the deflector is phase modulated by a synthetic lowfrequency RamanNath regime grating that has a structure of an optimized phaseonly computergenerated hologram. We demonstrate, e.g., electronic control of the state of spatial coherence of light, Gaussian to flattop conversion, and the generation of arrays of equally intense but mutually incoherent light spots.
