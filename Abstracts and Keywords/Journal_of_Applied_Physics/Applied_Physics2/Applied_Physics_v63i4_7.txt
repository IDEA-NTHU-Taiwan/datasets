Farreaching conclusions, not supported by the data presented, are drawn in this paper. An enhanced nuclear magnetization is reported by the authors and said to suggest a collective motion of the water molecules in pores of some porous rocks partially saturated with water. However, the data for these special rocks show a nuclear magnetization deficiency at partial fluid saturation and an even greater deficiency at full saturation. Multimodal distributions of pore sizes in rocks are inferred from multiexponetial relaxation data. However, these data would have to be far more accurate than experimentally possible to resolve the questions raised.
