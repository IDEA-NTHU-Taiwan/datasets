Al2O3 films about 1000 Å thick were deposited on polished Si(100) substrates by the reactive ionized cluster beam method. It was found that the index of refraction, the etch rate in HF, and the microstructure of the films could be controlled by varying substrate temperatures up to 600	°C and acceleration voltages between 0.25 and 3 kV.
