The twinning pattern in single crystals of YBa2Cu3O7 has been studied by differential interference contrast microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. In 10% of crystals studied large untwinned orthorhombic [(ba)/a=2.7%] domains exceeding 100×100 ¼m2 in area are observed. The structure of twin defects is described and the existence of two types of minority domains is inferred. We infer from the domain structures a mechanism for the growth of twinning patterns in single crystals.
