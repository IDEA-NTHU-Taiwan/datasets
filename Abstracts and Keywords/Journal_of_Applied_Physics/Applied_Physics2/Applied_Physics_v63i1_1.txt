A discrete, timedependent energy deposition model is developed and applied to the study of highenergy electronbeam (100 eV10 MeV) deposition in atomic oxygen. Secondary electron distributions are computed and observed to relax to steadystate results. Characteristic relaxation times are shown. The loss function, mean energies per electronion pair production, production efficiencies, and distribution functions are presented for a wide range of energies. The model uses the latest experimental and theoretical cross sections as input.
