We have obtained atomicresolution images of NbSe2 single crystals in air. Constantheight images clearly show the expected atomic structure, and can distinguish the two inequivalent halves of the unit cell. Constantcurrent images show an anomalously high atomic corrugation, associated with elastic deformation of the sample. Surface contamination probably plays an important role in transmitting the tipsample forces. A largerscale apparent buckling of the surface with a period of several times the atomic spacing is sometimes observed.
