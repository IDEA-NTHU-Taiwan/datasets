Lowtemperature (10300 K) dielectric and pyroelectric properties of morphotropicphaseboundary leadbariumniobate tungstenbronze ferroelectric single crystals have been investigated. Strong Debyelike dielectric dispersion, along a nonpolar direction (perpendicular to the polarization direction), has been observed and characterized by dielectric spectrum techniques. A direct charge measurement method has been used to study the lowtemperature pyroelectric properties in polar and nonpolar directions. A frozenin polarization component in a nonpolar direction is also reported. The lowtemperature relaxation effects are explained by the internal reorientation polarization perturbation and a thermally agitated local dipole fluctuation model.
