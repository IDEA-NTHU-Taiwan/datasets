We compute analytically the tail of the electron distribution function, including the radial and axial diffusion, in a plasma generated by an electron beam of a few keV. With this we can determine the ionization efficiency of the tail electrons in creating bulk electrons. The asymptotic behavior that results, for large axial distances, is compared with experimental data for molecular oxygen plasma.
