A systematic study of the structural and magnetic properties of the RMo1.5Fe10.5Nx series, where R is Y, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, or Er, has been carried out using xray diffraction, magnetic measurements, and the Mössbauer effect. The 112 phase with Ce and Pr has been successfully stabilized. PrMo1.5Fe10.5Nx possesses excellent intrinsic magnetic properties, favorable for permanent magnet applications. The 112 phase, RMo1.5Fe10.5Nx, was also stabilized. Compared to RMo2Fe10Nx, this compound shows a higher Curie temperature and a larger saturation magnetization due to the lower Mo content.
