Using different optical diagnostic methods, namely interferometric holography and shadowgraphy, and utilizing a piezoelectric transducer for precise velocity determination, the laws of reflection and transmission of laserdriven shock waves through an obstacle in water are studied. Experimental results on the velocity of transmitted and reflected shock waves from different materials are reported.
