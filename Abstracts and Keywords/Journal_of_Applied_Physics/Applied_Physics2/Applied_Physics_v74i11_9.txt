Scaling relations are developed to allow estimation of the atomic hydrogen concentration at the substrate during diamond chemicalvapor deposition for both diffusiondominated and convectiondominated reactors. In the convectiondominated case, it is shown that there exists an optimal Mach number which maximizes the H concentration delivered to the substrate. In addition, when homogeneous recombination is taken into account, there exists an optimal operating pressure. This analysis shows that a sonic flow of highly dissociated hydrogen at a pressure near atmospheric is optimal for rapid growth of highquality diamond.
