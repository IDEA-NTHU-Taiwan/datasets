Impurity doping in InP layer grown by metalorganic vaporphase epitaxy using tertiarybutylphosphine and organic doping sources is presented. Diethylzinc and diethylselenide were used as the ptype and ntype doping sources, respectively. Electrical properties and surface morphology of the impuritydoped layers together with their growth condition dependence were investigated. Good controllability and reproducibility of the doping level were confirmed. The maximum doping levels of 1.8×1018 and 1×1019 cm3 were successfully attained for pInP and nInP, respectively. These results promise further safe metalorganic vaporphase epitaxy by using organic compounds for all precursors.
