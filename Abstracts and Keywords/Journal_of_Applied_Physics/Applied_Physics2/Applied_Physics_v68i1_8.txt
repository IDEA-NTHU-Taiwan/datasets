The effects of misfit strain on physical properties (lattice parameters, photoluminescence, and electron mobility) are discussed for In1xGaxP epilayers with a constant thickness of around 0.75 ¼m grown by metalorganic molecularbeam epitaxy on GaAs(001) substrates. The elastic accommodation of misfit strain is observed in the analysis of lattice parameters and energybandgap shift. Tensile strain is relaxed more easily than the compressive strain. Theoretical predictions of critical thickness for elasticstrain accommodation and of energybandgap shift agree well with experimental results. The energybandgap shift and electron mobility are relatively insensitive to dislocations generated by relaxation of the misfit strain.
