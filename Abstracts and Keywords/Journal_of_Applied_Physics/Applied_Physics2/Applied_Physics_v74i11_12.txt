Boron carbide thin films of several B/C ratios have been deposited on Si(111) using plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition from nidopentaborane(9) (B5H9) and methane (CH4). Xray diffraction studies of boron carbide thin films on Si(111) exhibited characteristic microcrystalline diffraction lines. Soft xray emission spectroscopy was used to verify that the local electronic structure and composition of each sample corresponded to a homogeneous solid solution boron carbide phase.
