The diffusion length of minority carriers in nCuInS2 samples is examined with electronbeaminduced current (EBIC) technique in vertical and planar configuration. Theories for the interpretation of the EBIC data from the experiments are reported. The holes as minority carriers show a diffusion length in the range of 1 ¼m, which is promising for high efficient solar energy conversion.
