A new method is presented of depositing zirconiascandia films following evaporation of the oxide powders using an electron beam. The relative amount of Sc was increased in steps from 0 to 8 at.	%. In the asdeposited state, all films were amorphous, but crystallized following postdeposition heat treatments. As the atomic percent of Sc was increased, the tetragonal phase of zirconia was stabilized. It appeared as a single phase for compositions with more than 5 at.	% Sc.
