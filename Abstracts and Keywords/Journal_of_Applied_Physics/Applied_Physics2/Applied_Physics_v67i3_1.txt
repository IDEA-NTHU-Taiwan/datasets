We present the growth and optical properties of Pb1xEuxTe films (0&lt;x&lt;0.55) prepared by a coevaporation technique onto BaF2 (111) substrates. They crystallize in a NaCltype structure. The lattice parameter increases as x increases but not in accordance with Vegards law. The optical band gap increases with increasing x values. Our data seem to indicate the stability of Eu2+ for 0&lt;x&lt;0.55.
