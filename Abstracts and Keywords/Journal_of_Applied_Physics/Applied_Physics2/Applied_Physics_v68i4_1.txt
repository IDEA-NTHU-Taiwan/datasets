We propose two semiempirical expressions for representing condensedphase heat capacities over a wide temperature range. Both can be integrated analytically to give closedform expressions for entropies and enthalpies. As examples, we use the expressions to represent the molar heat capacities, entropies, and enthalpies of Si	 and Al	.
