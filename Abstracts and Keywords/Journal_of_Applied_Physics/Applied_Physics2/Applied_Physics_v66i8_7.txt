The measured values of the Verdet constant of transparent plastic fiber materials such as the poly±methylstyrene and polystyrene are comparable to that of a NaCl crystal. In these magnetooptical plastics, the wavelength giving the maximum value of the figure of merit for a fibertype optical isolator is about 500 nm. They are also used for constructing plastic fiber sensors for higher magnetic field or higher current.
