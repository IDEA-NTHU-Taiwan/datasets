Ultrathin films of Fbridged Alphthalocyanine polymer, (AlPcF)n, grown by the molecularbeam epitaxy technique show unusual spectroscopic properties which can be described by the possibility of pseudomorphic layer formation at the thinfilm/substrate interface. A change in the electronic structure of the molecules of this layer is presumed to occur. The existence of the layer is directly related to the degree of epitaxy.
