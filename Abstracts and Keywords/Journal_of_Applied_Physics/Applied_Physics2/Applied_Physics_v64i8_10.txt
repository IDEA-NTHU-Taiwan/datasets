Compliance to the low electric field regime necessary for application of the third derivative functional form formalism is demonstrated for ionimplanted samples used to determine the doping level by photoreflectance spectroscopy. Due to field and doping inhomogeneity, the proper line shape is speculated to be described by a superposition of FranzKeldysh oscillations.
