The radiation hardness of fluorinated SiO2/Si interface in metaloxidesemiconductor fieldeffect transistors has been found to depend strongly on the amount of fluorine introduced. In this study, the fluorine was introduced by lowenergy F implantation onto the surface of the polycrystalline silicon gate electrode, followed by annealing at 950	°C to diffuse F into the gate SiO2 toward the SiO2/Si interface. The improved radiation hardness is attributed to the strain relaxation near the SiO2/Si interface by fluorine incorporation.
