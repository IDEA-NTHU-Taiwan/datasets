Superconducting YBa2Cu3O7 films with Tc=84 K were deposited on polished polycrystalline BeO substrate by reactive evaporation and in situ annealing in a lowpressure oxygen atmosphere. By this process the surface quality of the films is the very same as the substrate. At low annealing temperature (TR=650	°C) the film is not textured but shows good superconducting properties. The caxis orientation perpendicular to the plane of the substrate is observed for TR=780	°C.
