An InGaAsP superluminescent diode operating at 1.5 ¼m wavelength is successfully developed using a buried bent absorbing waveguide structure and antireflection coating to suppress lasing mode. Optical characteristics such as high output power (5 mW at 200 mA), broadband spectral width (6070 nm), short coherence length (about 30 ¼m), and low spectral modulation depth (less than 10%) are achieved. Injection current dependence of emitting wavelength and spectral width are also investigated.
