It is pointed out that it is inappropriate to use the thirdderivative functional form derived by Aspnes [Surf. Sci. 37, 418 (1973)] to fit the photoreflectance data of GaAs at the fundamental absorption edge when the lowfield condition is not satisfied. Instead, the FranzKeldysh oscillations can be used to determine the carrier concentration of the material.
