The oxidation behavior of reactively sputtered amorphous tungsten nitride of composition W80N20 was investigated in dry and wet oxidizing ambient in the temperature range of 450	°C575	°C. A single WO3 oxide phase is observed. The growth of the oxide follows a parabolic time dependence which is attributed to a process controlled by the diffusivity of the oxidant in the oxide. The oxidation process is thermally activated with an activation energy of 2.5±0.05 eV for dry ambient and 2.35±0.05 eV for wet ambient. The preexponential factor of the reaction constant for dry ambient is 1.1×1021 Å2/min; that for wet ambient is only about 10 times less and is equal to 1.3×1020 Å2/min.
