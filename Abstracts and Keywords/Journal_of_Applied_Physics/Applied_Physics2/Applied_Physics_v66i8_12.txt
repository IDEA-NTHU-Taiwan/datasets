We have found that at least four kinds of oxygenrelated thermal donors are distinguishable by their deeplevel transient spectroscopy peaks and generation kinetics around 520	°C for 10106 min in phosphorusdoped Czochralski silicon. Each kind of thermal donors successively appeared with its preceding kind decaying. The first appearing kind is identified as a family of thermal donors that have been most studied by many investigators. It is suggested that several kinds of thermal donors arise from various oxygen clusters with different sizes and thermal stabilities.
