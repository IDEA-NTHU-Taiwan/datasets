The firstorder Raman spectra of ZnWO4 single crystals have been obtained. All the vibrational frequencies are assigned by group theory. Among them the Bg modes at 269, 166, and 147 cm1 and Ag mode at 124 cm1 are reported for the first time. In view of xray structure data of ZnWO4, we suggest that the frequencies of vibrational modes can be assigned on the basis of analysis with octahedral WO6 as a starting point, instead of tetrahedral WO4.
