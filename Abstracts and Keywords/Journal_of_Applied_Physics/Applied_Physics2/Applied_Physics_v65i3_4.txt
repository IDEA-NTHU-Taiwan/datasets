Zinc ferrite (ZnxFe3xO4) films have been deposited on a singlecrystal Al2O3 substrate by pulsed ruby laserinduced vaporization from a sintered ZnFe2O4 pellet. The film structure has been determined by smallangle xray diffraction measurements, and the film morphology by scanning electron microscopy. The microstructural features have been brought out by conversion electron Mössbauer spectroscopy. The dependence of the film properties on the oxygen partial pressure and substrate temperature during deposition is studied to explore optimized conditions for deposition of near singlephase stoichiometric films.
