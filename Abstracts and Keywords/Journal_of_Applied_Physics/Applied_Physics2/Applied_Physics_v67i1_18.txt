An improved boundary condition treatment for the timedependent Schrödinger equation applied to resonanttunneling diode simulation has been developed. This treatment is halfimplicit, or centered in time, and allows larger time steps than the previous explicit treatment. The method does not complicate the timedependent calculation since the resulting matrix is still tridiagonal.
