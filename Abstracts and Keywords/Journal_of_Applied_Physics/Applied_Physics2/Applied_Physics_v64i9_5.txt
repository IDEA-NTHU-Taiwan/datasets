A doublebeam interferometer which incorporates quasioptical components developed in this laboratory has been used to measure near millimeterwave dielectric properties of a variety of ceramic materials. We report here the results obtained on samples of various standard and advanced ceramics including alumina, silicon nitride, beryllia, and boron nitride. Results are compared with the data obtained by other researchers on similar samples.
