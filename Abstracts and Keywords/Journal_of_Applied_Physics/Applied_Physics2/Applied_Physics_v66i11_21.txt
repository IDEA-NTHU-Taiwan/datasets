Thin films of YBaCuO were prepared as a superlattice of three constituents on SrTiO3 (100) substrates from three electron guns using a dedicated, computercontrolled evaporator. The results indicate that the asdeposited thin films grow as a superlattice of the three constituents, with a mixture of amorphous and polycrystalline regions. After annealing, however, the multilayer films are converted to the homogeneous superconducting phase; the morphology, studied with transmission electron microscopy, consisted of an array of orthogonal interconnecting rectangular bars. The better films had Tc(R=0)=90	K and Jc=2.9×106	A/cm2 at 4.2 K. The selected area e
