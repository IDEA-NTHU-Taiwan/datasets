The dielectric relaxation function is defined as the transient current generated by the application of a unit voltage. In analogy with viscoelasticity, a second relaxation function can be defined as the transient voltage generated by the application of a unit current. Each of these functions generates its own distribution function of relaxation times. If one of the distribution functions is truncated, the other has been found to contain single lines apparently devoid of physical significance. Using a particular test function derived from the Curievon Schweidler law1,2 [Ann. Chim. Phys. 18, 20 (1899); Handbuch der Elektrizitaet und des Magnetisms (Barth, Leipzig, 1918), p. 286] it is shown here that such lines do not appear in all instances. On the other hand, the relaxation function, as a monotonously decreasing function, frequently is believed to contain only two types of parameters, one energy dissipative and another energy storing. However, using the same test function as above, one can prove that a relaxation function can contain all three types of parameters, one dissipative and two energystoring ones. Therefore, a relaxation system cannot, in general, be defined as a twoparameter system. An energydissipative parameter represents resistive elements, while energystoring parameters represent capacitive and inductive elements.
