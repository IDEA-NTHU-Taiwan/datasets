Measurements of the magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and heat capacity are reported for the polycrystalline YbNiAl4 intermetallic compound. Ç(T) has been measured up to 1000 K and its behavior is typical of a compound with the valence fluctuation between Yb3+ and Yb2+. This is especially evident from a broad maximum observed at 400 K and interpreted in frames of the interconfiguration fluctuation model. The Sommerfeld coefficient derived from the heat capacity measurements takes a small value of ³ = 16mJ	mol1	K2. The low temperature resistivity follows the AT2 dependence characteristic of a Fermi liquid.
