Strontium based complex perovskites are potential candidates for microwave integrated circuit applications. In the present article, we report on Raman scattering studies of cubic and noncubic structures of Sr(B0.52Nb0.5)O3 [B2=Ga, In, Y, La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, and Yb] based complex-perovskite materials for an improved understanding of structure-property relations. The spectral results are compared to some tantalum analogues of known crystal structure. The present study reveals a higher degree of ordering for the tantalum compounds compared to those of the niobium analogues. Vibrational studies show a correlation between the tolerance factor and symmetry of these materials. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.
