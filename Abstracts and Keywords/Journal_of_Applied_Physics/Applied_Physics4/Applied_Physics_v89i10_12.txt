We report a study of the slow transient phenomena observed, under continuous illumination, in the response of the sandwich-type structure indiumtinoxide/poly(4,43-dipenthoxy-32-octyl2,22:52,23-terthiophene)/Al. The analysis of the transient component of the open-circuit voltage revealed that recombination processes are greatly enhanced under illumination, limiting the performance of this kind of devices. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.
