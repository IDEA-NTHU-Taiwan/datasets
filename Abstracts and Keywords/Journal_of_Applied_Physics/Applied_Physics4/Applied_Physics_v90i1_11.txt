Structural and electrical properties of SrRuO3 thin films grown at various temperatures (Td) were investigated. The films grew epitaxially when Tdg350
°C. The dependences of crystallinity, conductivity, and carrier density on temperature were less pronounced when Td was above 400
°C, whereas crystallinity and conductivity were markedly degraded with decreasing Td when Tdf400
°C. Owing to this unique dependence, SrRuO3 thin film deposited at Td as low as 400
°C showed an acceptable quality for application to electronic devices. For the SrRuO3/SrTiO3/SrRuO3 trilayered capacitor structure, when the top SrRuO3 layer was grown at 400
°C, a symmetric permittivityvoltage curve was observed and the SrRuO3 permittivity value of 340 õ0 was obtained. When the top SrRuO3 layer was grown at 600
°C, the permittivity value of SrTiO3 decreased and even a slight asymmetry of the permittivityvoltage curve could ever be observed. This indicates that the lower temperature deposition of SrRuO3 thin film causes less interface degradation. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.
