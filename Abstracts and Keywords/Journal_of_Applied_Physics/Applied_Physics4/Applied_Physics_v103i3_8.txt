A semianalytical model is presented for representing the magnetization switching in arrays of nanostructures with uniaxial anisotropy that includes both the dipolar interactions between structures in the array and a distribution of switching fields for the structures within the arrays. The net magnetic field experienced by each individual structure is the sum of the externally applied field and the local field from the other structures. Here the local field was calculated by subdividing each nanostructure into discrete magnetic moments. The field dependence of each structure within the array was represented by assigned switching behavior. The simplest behavior assumed a structure was wholly reversed at a given axial field (square switching), while more complex behavior was also implemented using both a StonerWohlfarth representation of switching and switching behavior that included a zero magnetization state to represent a vortex state. A distribution of switching fields within an array was incorporated by discretizing a normal distribution to assign switching fields to each structure. The variation from noninteracting switching to interacting was investigated for permalloy (NiFe) arrays of 1.2×0.6¼m, 0.6×0.3¼m, and 0.2×0.1¼m ellipses. The model is compared with magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements of lithographically defined arrays and shown to give good qualitative and reasonable quantitative agreement with the measurements. The effect of interactions upon the StonerWohlfarth astroid is also shown.
