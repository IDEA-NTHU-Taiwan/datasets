Fictive temperature (Tf) and fluorine (F)-doping concentration dependences of self-trapped holes (STHs) in silica glasses created by UV irradiation at low temperatures have been studied by the electron-paramagnetic-resonance method. It was found that the yield of STH decreases with decreasing Tf and increasing F-doping concentration. In combination with infrared spectra measurements, the correlation among Tf, F-doping concentration, SiO bond length, and SiOSi bond angle was elucidated. We conclude that the change in both Tf and F doping can modify the network of SiO2 glass, leading to the suppression of the formation of STHs.
