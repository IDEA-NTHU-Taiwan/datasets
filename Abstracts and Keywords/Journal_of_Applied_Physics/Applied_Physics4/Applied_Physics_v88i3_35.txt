This article investigates the dynamic movement process of a 180° domain wall in an external electric field. By modeling the domain wall movement as a dynamic process, the induced electric and magnetic fields due to a growing general ellipsoidal 180° domain under the action of a given electric field was derived explicitly. A general form of the energy release rate was derived through a surface integral, which can serve as the driving force for the movement of the surface. Based on the solution, the released electromagnetic energy during the dynamic process was evaluated. This electromagnetic energy is used to compensate the surface energy increase and the energy dissipation due to the finite velocity of the domain wall movement. Following the result, an equation is established to determine the growth speed of the 180° domain. Finally, the cases where the domain shape is cylindrical and spherical, and the domain wall propagates along the radial direction and the applied electric field direction, respectively, were considered in detail as illustrative examples. It is found that the resistance caused by the depolarization field for the wall to grow along the direction of the applied electric field is only one fifth of the value for the wall to grow along the radial direction. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.
