Simulations are performed to investigate the uniqueness of simultaneous determination of electronic transport properties (the carrier lifetime, the carrier diffusivity, and the front surface recombination velocity) of silicon wafers by laterally resolved modulated free carrier absorption (MFCA) and multiparameter fitting. The dependences of MFCA amplitude and phase on these transport properties at different pump-probe-beam separations and modulation frequencies are analyzed. The uncertainties of the fitted parameter values are analyzed by investigating the dependences of a mean square variance including both the amplitude error and phase error on corresponding electronic transport parameters. Simulation results show that the electronic transport parameters can be determined accurately through fitting experimental MFCA data carrying both frequency- and space-domain information of carrier diffusion to a rigorous MFCA model. Among the three transport parameters, the carrier diffusivity can be determined most precisely, with an uncertainty of less than ±5%, due to the highest sensitivity of the laterally resolved MFCA signal to the diffusivity. The highly accurate determination of the diffusivity further improves the precision of the carrier lifetime and the front surface recombination velocity values simultaneously determined via multiparameter fitting. Experiments were performed with a silicon wafer and the results were in good agreement with the theoretical simulations.
