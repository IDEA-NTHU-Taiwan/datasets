Piezoelectric materials exhibit nonlinear behavior when subjected to large electrical or mechanical loads. This strong nonlinear material behavior is induced by localized polarization switching (i.e., change of the polarization direction) at the subgrain level. In this article, a nonlinear finite element code is described to model polarization switchings in piezoceramics subjected to large electromechanical loads. The local polarization switching criterion is based on electric displacement combined with stability arguments. To evaluate the model, three cases are studied in this article: a partially electroded specimen simulating 180° polarization switching, a fully electroded specimen simulating 90° switching and a plate containing a void. The analytical results are compared with experimental data obtained from Moiré interferometer with reasonable agreement. Stresses in the vicinity of the voids are computed and the results are used to explain fatigue behavior observed in piezoceramics. It has been determined that, for a material undergoing full polarization switching, compressive stress along the polarization direction reduces internal stresses and extends fatigue life. If the applied electric field value is below the coercive field limit, the compressive prestress can increase the stresses thus reducing fatigue life. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.
