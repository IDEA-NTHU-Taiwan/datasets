The Raman spectra for ZnS1xTex alloys were investigated for a wide range of Te composition x. The lattice vibration showed two-mode behavior. The asymmetric broadening of the line shape was found to be dependent on the Te composition x and could be explained by the Spatial Correlation model. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.
