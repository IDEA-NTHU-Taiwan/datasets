Photoluminescence of Eu3+ doped TbPO4 (TbPO4:Eu) inverse opal photonic crystals was investigated. The results showed that the energy transfer from the donor Tb3+ to the acceptor Eu3+ can be enhanced effectively by the photonic band gaps in the photonic crystals. When the fluorescence emission wavelength of the donor Tb3+ overlapped the photonic band gap, the fluorescence intensity of the acceptor Eu3+ was obviously enhanced due to the inhibition of radiative emission of donor in the inverse opal photonic crystals.
