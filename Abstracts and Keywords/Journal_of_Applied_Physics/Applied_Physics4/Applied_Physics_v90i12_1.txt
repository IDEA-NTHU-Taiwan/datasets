Nitridation of InP is performed by KrF excimer laser irradiation in an NH3 ambient. The NIn and NP bonds are formed in the irradiated area in proportion to the number of laser pulses. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra of the nitrided samples contain a small concentration of oxide components after aging in an air atmosphere than nonirradiated samples © 2001 American Institute of Physics.
