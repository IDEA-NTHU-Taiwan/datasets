This article reports the preparation of submicrometric magnetic particles which are promising parts for fabrication of three-dimensional magneto-photonic crystals. In our experiments SiO2 spheres with diameter of about 260 nm were coated with Fe3O4 fine particles from an aqueous solution at room temperature. It is found that spheres coated with Fe3O4 fine particles with a diameter of about 20 nm are synthesized when the ratio of Fe3+/Fe2+ is in the range 50%100% and the pH value is in the range 810. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.
