We have investigated the laser interference crystallization (LIC) of amorphous germanium films on (100)-oriented GaAs substrates using nanosecond laser pulses. We demonstrate that LIC can produce periodic arrays of epitaxially crystallized Ge lines on GaAs with submicrometer widths. The gratings display a surface undulation with faceted surfaces, which depends on laser fluency. The undulation is attributed to the lateral solidification process induced by the temperature gradients created during the LIC process. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.
