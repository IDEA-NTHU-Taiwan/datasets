We present an x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) investigation performed at the Fe K edge in the intermetallic Nd2Fe14BHx and Y2Fe14BHx compounds with controlled hydrogen content. The present study clearly reveals that hydrogen exerts an appreciable influence on the electronic structure of the whole system, and in particular on the rare-earth sublattice. The combined study of both magnetization and XMCD indicates that the magnetic moments of Nd decrease upon hydrogen uptake. © 2003 American Institute of Physics.
