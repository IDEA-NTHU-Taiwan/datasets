In this work, we studied the leakage mechanism at different temperatures in Pt/SrTaO/Pt and Pt/BiTaO/Pt thin film capacitors. The dielectrics were deposited by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition at 360	°C as amorphous layers, and the complete process flow of the capacitors was kept below 500	°C. Conduction is governed by Poole-Frenkel emission down to < 15 and < 20nm for SrTaO and BiTaO, respectively. From the Poole-Frenkel plots, we extracted an index of refraction of < 2.1 for SrTaO and < 2.5 for BiTaO, and an energy of < 0.8eV from involved trap centers to the conduction band for both dielectrics.
