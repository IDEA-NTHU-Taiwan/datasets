By incorporating a random interfacial exchange interaction into the LandauLifshitzGilbert equation, a unified picture of exchange bias for single crystals, textured crystals, twin structures, and polycrystals of antiferromagnets is presented. It is found that the lateral interaction in the antiferromagnet is a key element governing the exchange bias and magnetization reversal of the ferromagnet. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.
