Upconversion emission from Tm3+ and Ho3+ ions in a yttriumaluminumgarnet crystal was observed on resonant excitation of the 3H4 level of Tm3+ and the 5I4 level of Ho3+ with a Ti:sapphire laser at room temperature and 10 K. The upconversion and the energy transfer mechanisms between Tm3+ and Ho3+ ions are discussed. A rate equation model is developed which supported the energy transfer mechanism. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.
