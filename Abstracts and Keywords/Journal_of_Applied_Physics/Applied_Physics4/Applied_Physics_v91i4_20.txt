Cross sections for the elastic scattering system of 4He+Ni have been investigated. Natural nickel was bombarded by 4He ions in the laboratory energy range of 3.014.3 MeV and the intensity of helium backscattering through laboratory angles of 96°, 117°, and 137° was observed. From measured yield data, the cross sections were extracted for the direct Ni(4He,4He)Ni scattering process as well as for the inverse recoil scattering process 4He(58Ni,4He)58Ni by calculating the kinematical reversal of the reaction. The experimental helium scattering angles convert to helium recoil angles of 20°, 30°, and 40°, and the incident helium ion energies to 43.5207 MeV for incident 58Ni ions in the reversed reaction. Optical model parameters for helium elastic scattering were determined by using a measured scattering angular distribution at helium ion energy of 14.0 MeV and the energy distributions. These parameters were then used to calculate the elastic scattering of the 4He+Ni system for both the direct and reversed processes over the entire energy-angle plane within the energy ranges studied. Threshold energies for the 4He+Ni system above which the nuclear effects render the Rutherford cross sections invalid have been determined for the angles measured. The optical model was then again used to predict the thresholds for all scattering and recoil angles. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.
