For SrS:Cu,Ag thin film phosphors, a postdeposition annealing step is imperative in order to obtain bright photo- or electroluminescence. However, it is not clear to date what is the most important effect of this treatment, a recrystallization of the host lattice or a redistribution of the activators. The present article discusses the microscopic emission characteristics of annealed photoluminescent layers SrS:Cu,Ag. Using cathodoluminescence measurements, it is shown that emission, originating from the grain boundaries, is very weak compared to the emission from the bulk of the grains. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.
