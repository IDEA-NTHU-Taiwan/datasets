It has recently been found that large uniaxial anisotropy fields in excess of 120 kA/m (1500 Oe) can be created in thin (35 nm) films of Co by obliquely sputtered Ta underlayers. This anisotropy can be used to pin the bottom film of a spin valve while having only a modest effect on the top free film, separated by a 2.5 nm Cu spacer layer. This article describes measurements of thermal stability in these Ta-pinned spin valves. Using room temperature giant magnetoresistance (GMR) as a measure, we find that the structure is stable under cumulative 20 min anneals at 25
°C intervals up to 300
°C; GMR decreases to zero upon further anneals up to 450
°C. Measurements taken at elevated temperatures reveal that GMR decreases linearly with temperature, extrapolating to zero at approximately 425
°C, while the anisotropy field is much less temperature dependent, remaining nearly constant up to 150
°C and gradually decreasing to 50% of its room temperature value at 325
°C. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.
