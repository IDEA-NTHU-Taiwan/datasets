Analysis of hole transport in cascaded p-SiSiGe quantum well structures is performed using self-consistent rate equations simulations. The hole subband structure is calculated using the 6×6kÅp model, and then used to find carrier relaxation rates due to the alloy disorder, acoustic, and optical phonon scattering, as well as hole-hole scattering. The simulation accounts for the in-plane k-space anisotropy of both the hole subband structure and the scattering rates. Results are presented for prototype THzSiSiGe quantum cascade structures.
