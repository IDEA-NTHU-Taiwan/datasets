Herein we have made two Mn-based high spin molecule samples, S=10 and S=9. Both samples show step hysteresis below 3 K, and their resonant fields are regularly spaced. Changes in temperature shift the resonant fields. The temperature dependence of the observed resonant fields can be fitted well with only a single-state tunneling if the mean-field interaction is taken into account. We also find that both the upward shift of the small step-index resonant fields and the downward shift of the large step-index resonant fields are due to mutual interactions. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.
