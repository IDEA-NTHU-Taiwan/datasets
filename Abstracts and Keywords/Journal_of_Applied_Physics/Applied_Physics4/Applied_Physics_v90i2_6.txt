A gauge invariant quantum kinetic equation which includes impact ionization, intracollisional field effect, and collisional broadening is derived in the frame of nonequilibrium Greens functions. We obtain analytical expressions for the impact ionization rate. For the wide band gap material ZnS, a substantial increase of the rate due to collisional broadening is obtained for moderate field strengths E}500
