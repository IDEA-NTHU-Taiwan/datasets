Porous silicon (PS) based metal/PS/p-Si structures with PS layer of different thickness were prepared on moderate- and high-resistivity substrates. Measurements of currentvoltage (IV) characteristics and impedance at various temperatures were used for the investigation of the electrical properties of these structures. Electrical properties of the structures with relatively thin (1 ¼m) PS layer significantly differ from those of thick structures. The exponential forward bias IV dependencies for thin structures spread over several orders of magnitude with a low value of quality factor (close to 2) and have activation temperature dependencies with an activation energy equal to half the c-Si band gap. The reverse current has a square root dependence on the reverse bias voltage and the activation energy is equal to half the c-Si band gap. Therefore, it was concluded that the reverse and forward currents in thin PS-based device structures were determined by the generation and recombination of carriers in the depletion region of the c-Si substrate. It was shown that a large area spreading current exists in structures made on highly resistive substrates, which appears to be due to a highly conductive inverse (n-type) layer formed in the p-Si substrate at the PS/p-Si heterojunction. The spreading effect leads to high reverse currents and high capacitance of the device structures made on highly resistive substrates. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.
