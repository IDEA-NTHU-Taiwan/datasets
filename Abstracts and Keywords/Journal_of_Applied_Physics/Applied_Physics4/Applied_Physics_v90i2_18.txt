We report an experimental determination of the pyroelectric coefficient for strained InGaAs layers in a pseudomorphic piezoelectric In0.17Ga0.83As/GaAs multiquantum well in a p-i-n diode configuration which was grown on a (111)B
GaAs substrate by molecular-beam epitaxy. By analyzing the FranzKeldysh oscillations in the photoreflectance spectra over the temperature range 11300 K, we obtained the temperature dependence of the piezoelectric field, from which the temperature variation of the piezoelectric constant e14 was deduced. A linear dependence of e14 with temperature was observed. Therefore, the strain-induced component of the pyroelectric coefficient of (9.3±0.3)×107
C/m2
K was determined for this material system. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.
