In this reply, the authors show that the argument by Scott regarding the band gap of bulk SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) is not based on concrete evidence. The authors will also show additional data from a Raman study of a powdered SBT sample to prove that the surface of the specimen was not covered by Bi2O3. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.
