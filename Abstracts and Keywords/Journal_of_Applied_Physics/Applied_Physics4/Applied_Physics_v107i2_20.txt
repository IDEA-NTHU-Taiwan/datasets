Tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) are potential successors of metal-oxide-semiconductor FETs because scaling the supply voltage below 1 V is possible due to the absence of a subthreshold-swing limit of 60 mV/decade. The modeling of the TFET performance, however, is still preliminary. We have developed models allowing a direct comparison between the single-gate, double-gate, and gate-all-around configuration at high drain voltage, when the drain-voltage dependence is negligible, and we provide improved insight in the TFET physics. The dependence of the tunnel current on device parameters is analyzed, in particular, the scaling with gate-dielectric thickness, channel thickness, and dielectric constants of gate dielectric and channel material. We show that scaling the gate-dielectric thickness improves the TFET performance more than scaling the channel thickness and that improvements are often overestimated. There is qualitative agreement between our model and our experimental data.
