Problems with scaling of conductive-system experimental Mdat3(É) and Ãdat2(É) data are considered and resolved by dispersive-relaxation-model fitting and comparison. Scaling is attempted for both synthetic and experimental M3(É) data sets. A crucial element in all experimental frequency-response data is the influence of the high-frequency-limiting dipolar-and-vibronic dielectric constant µD, often designated µ, and not related to ionic transport. It is shown that µD precludes scaling of Mdat3(É) for ionic materials when the mobile-charge concentration varies. When the effects of µD are properly removed from the data, however, such scaling is viable. Only the Ã2(É) and µ3(É) parts of immittance response are uninfluenced by µD. Thus, scaling is possible for experimental Ã2(É) data sets under concentration variation if the shape parameter of a well-fitting model remains constant and if any parts of the response not associated with bulk ionic transport are eliminated. Comparison between the predictions of the original-modulus-formalism (OMF) response model of 19721973 and a corrected version of it that takes proper account of µD, the corrected modulus formalism (CMF), demonstrates that the role played by µD (or µ) in the OMF is incorrect. Detailed fitting of data for three different ionic glasses using a KohlrauschWilliamsWatts response model, the KWW1, for OMF and CMF analysis clearly demonstrates that the OMF leads to inconsistent shape-parameter (²1) estimates and the CMF does not. The CMF KWW1 model is shown to subsume, correct, and generalize the recent disparate scaling/fitting approaches of Sidebottom, León, Roling, and Ngai. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.
