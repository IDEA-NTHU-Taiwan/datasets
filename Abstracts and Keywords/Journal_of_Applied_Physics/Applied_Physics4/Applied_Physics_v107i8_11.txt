Mn-doped Bi(Mg1/2Ti1/2)PbTiO3 disordered ferroelectric ceramics were studied under ac electric fields and a crossover from a nearly constant loss to a superlinear power-law behavior was observed. Our results confirmed that the nearly constant loss behavior also exists in disordered ferroelectrics. The exponent of the superlinear power-law was found to be temperature dependent. Such a behavior was related to the local movements of oxygen vacancies.
