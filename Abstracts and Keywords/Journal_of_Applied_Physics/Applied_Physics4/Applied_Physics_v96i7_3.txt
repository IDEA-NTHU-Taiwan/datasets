A plane electron wave incident on a tunnel-transparent potential barrier formed by the potential V(x,t)=V0(x)+V1(x)cosÉt generates, in addition to the usual stationary transmitted and reflected stationary waves, also transmitted and reflected electron waves oscillating with the same frequency É. The transmitted oscillating wave can serve as the basis for transit-time microwave generators oscillating in the terahertz range. (Such oscillators are ballistic analogs of the tunnel-emission transit-time diode oscillators suggested almost half a century ago.) In the special case of a rectangular potential barrier, we describe the dependence of a small transmitted oscillating wave amplitude on the frequency É and the value of V1(x). We consider two forms of V1(x): (1) homogeneous oscillation of the height of the rectangular barrier and (2) V1(x)=a´(xx1) [where ´(x) is the Dirac delta function and 0&lt;x1&lt;w; w is the barrier thickness]. For sufficiently high frequencies É determined by the time for tunneling, a much higher emission of the transmitted oscillating wave takes place in comparison with the results of quasistatic calculations.
