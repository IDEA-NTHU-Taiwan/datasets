Nanocrystalline NiP and NiXP (X=W,Co,Cu) alloys deposited on the surfaces of SiC whiskers were evaluated on their roles in the catalysis growth of carbon nanocoils during thermal pyrolysis of acetylene. Experimental results indicated that the NiP and NiWP systems were effective in catalyzing the growth of carbon nanocoils with varying chirality. Single-particle related growth of the single- or multihelixed carbon nanocoils was found, which suggests that these nanocoils have specific growth characteristics closely related to the symmetroid or surface symmetry of the catalyst particle. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.
