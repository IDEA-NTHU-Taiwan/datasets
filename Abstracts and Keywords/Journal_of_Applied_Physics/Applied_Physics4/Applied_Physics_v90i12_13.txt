Epitaxial growth of (111)-oriented CoSi2 has been achieved on a scratch-free 6H-SiC(0001)Si substrate. The surface was prepared using atmospheric hydrogen etching and ultrahigh vacuum Si cleaning. A high-quality CoSi2 thin film was obtained by a modified template method and co-deposition of Co and Si at 550
°C. The structure and morphology of the film is studied by means of reflection high electron energy diffraction, x-ray absorption fine structure, x-ray diffraction, and atomic force microscopy. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.
