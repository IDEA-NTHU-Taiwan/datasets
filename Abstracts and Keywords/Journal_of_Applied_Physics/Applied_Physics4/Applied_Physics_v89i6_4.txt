We have developed a technique allowing photocurrent (PC) mapping of silicon surface in contact with an electrolyte which offers an unprecedented spatial resolution. The photocurrent is generated by near-field optics using an optical tip with a 100 nm diameter aperture as an illumination source. The comparison between topographic and photocurrent mapping of SiO2/Si mesas is used to demonstrate the feasibility of such a technique. Topographic and PC images show 300 nm lateral resolution. It is shown that this resolution is topography limited, i.e., determined by the tip-topography interaction. Indeed, PC mapping on topography-less patterned porous silicon/silicon samples shows that the lateral resolution can be as good as 100 nm, limited by the aperture size. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.
