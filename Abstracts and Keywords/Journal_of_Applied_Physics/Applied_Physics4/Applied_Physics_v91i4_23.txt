Largely tunable midinfrared (812 ¼m) generation is obtained in GaAs and ZnSe slabs by difference frequency mixing of optical parametric oscillator output waves (<2 ¼m). The coherence lengths determined in semiconductor wedges are in excellent agreement with estimates from known Sellmeir formulas. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.
