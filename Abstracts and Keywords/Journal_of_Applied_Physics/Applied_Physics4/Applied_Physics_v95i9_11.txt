We have investigated the microstructures of melt-spun Sm(Co0.58Fe0.31Cu0.04Zr0.05B0.02)z (z=7.5 and 12) ribbons by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and three dimensional atom probe (3DAP) to correlate them with the hard magnetic properties. The ribbon with z=7.5 has a high coercivity (iHc<12
kOe) while the ribbon with z=12 possesses a low coercivity (iHc<4.9
kOe). The high iHc ribbon comprises of nanocrystals (<10 nm) having 1:7H (TbCu7) type structure as main phase. However, in the low iHc ribbon, the microstructure consists of both 1:7H and 2:17H
(Th2Ni17) phases with crystal size ranging from 50 to 80 nm. The low coercivity ribbon also contains (CoFeZr)23B6 (M23B6 type) soft magnetic phase. The low coercivity obtained in the melt-spun ribbon with z=12 is due to: (i) the formation of Th2Ni17 type low anisotropy phase, (ii) the presence of boron-rich soft magnetic phase, and (iii) larger crystal size. Realization of high coercivity in the ribbon with z=7.5 is due to the formation of 1:7H, a high anisotropy phase, as well as reduced grain size. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.
