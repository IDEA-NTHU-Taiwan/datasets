A GinzburgLandau type theory of interaction of randomly distributed local dipoles in a paraelectric crystal is developed. The interaction is caused by the polarization of the host lattice generated by these dipoles. The obtained effective Hamiltonian of the dipoledipole interaction is employed for the Monte Carlo simulation of ferroelectric properties of a system with off-center dopant ions producing local dipoles. The computer simulation shows that at low dopant ion concentration the paraelectric state transforms into a macroscopically paraelectric state consisting of randomly oriented polar clusters. These clusters amplify the effective dipole moment and dramatically increase the dielectric constant. The interaction between the clusters results in a spectrum of relaxation time and transition to the relaxor state. The real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility of this state are calculated. At intermediate dopant concentration, the material undergoes a diffuse phase transition into a ferroelectric state smeared within a temperature range. A further increase in the dopant concentration makes the transition sharper and closer to the conventional ferroelectric transition. The results obtained are compared with the behavior of the K1xLixTaO3 relaxor ferroelectric. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.
