The Ba0.65xSr0.35MgxTiO3 ceramics was prepared by conventional solid method. The effects of the Mg2+ content on the crystal structure and dielectric properties of Ba0.65xSr0.35MgxTiO3 ceramics were investigated. The results show that as the Mg2+ content increases, the influence of Mg2+ on the crystal structure of Ba0.65xSr0.35MgxTiO3 ceramics undergoes three different stages, which orderly are the in situ synthesis of the A site, then the replacement on the B site and at last the replacement on the A site. As a result, the Curie peak and the loss peak of Ba0.65xSr0.35MgxTiO3 ceramics gradually decrease first with X from 0 to 2.5 mol	% and increase afterward with X above 2.5 mol	%.
