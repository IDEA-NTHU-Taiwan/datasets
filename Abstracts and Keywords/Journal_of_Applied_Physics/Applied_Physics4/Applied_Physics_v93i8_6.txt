Metallic zinc nanowires are synthesized by evaporating ZnO powder mixed with graphite in an NH3 flowing carrying gas environment. The majority of the as-synthesized zinc nanowires are single crystalline and free from structural defects, whereas a small portion of the nanowires consists of single-crystalline Zn nanorod segments. The zinc nanowires usually have serpentine geometries, with lengths up to a few micrometers and diameters 20 to 200 nanometers. The growth direction of the nanowires is usually ±[001]. Most zinc nanowires are covered with an oxide layer. © 2003 American Institute of Physics.
