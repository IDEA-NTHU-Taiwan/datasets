The Fröhlich interaction between electrons and surface-optical phonons is studied by using the dielectric continuum model. First, the eigenfrequencies of the surface phonons are calculated. A result for the normalized displacement of the phonon is obtained and a more accurate electron-surface phonon Fröhlich interaction Hamiltonian is calculated. The surface-optical-phonon-assisted scattering rate of an electron in free-standing GaN quantum dots is calculated with natural linewidth broadening. Finally, illustrative examples of surface-optical-phonon-assisted scattering rates are calculated to clarify the potential importance of SO-phonon-assisted transitions in potential applications of quantum dots.
