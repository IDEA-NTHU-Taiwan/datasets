Silicon dioxide films were grown in oxygen ambient under negative corona stress at low temperatures (400450
°C). Fourier transform infrared spectra of these films show a peak at 935cm1 along with the conventional transverse optic mode peaks around 1074, 800, and 456cm1. A broad shoulder at 1150cm1 was also observed. The extra peak is attributed to the presence of SiO42 ions and could be the outcome of incomplete oxidation at the surface. The films indicated properties similar to a fully relaxed thermally grown silicon dioxide film with a contradictory nature. The results of these experiments can be comprehensively explained only by assuming the presence of some mixed phase of SiO2. © 2003 American Institute of Physics.
