This Comment attempts to clarify issues relating to the determination of the energy separation between the valence band maximum and the Fermi level in surface-sensitive photoemission experiments on wurtzite GaN. Such considerations are relevant to the measurement of band bending at the surface of wide-band gap materials. © 2003 American Institute of Physics.
