GaInN quantum wells with reduced piezoelectric field deposited epitaxially on the {101} facets of selectively grown GaN stripes show distinct polarization properties of the emitted light. Systematic electro- and photoluminescence studies demonstrate that the light is linearly polarized parallel to the stripes, representing the 110	 direction of the GaN crystal. Our model calculations show that this is a consequence of the strain-induced valence-band splitting depending on the crystal orientation. The polarization ratio is calculated and compared to measured values.
