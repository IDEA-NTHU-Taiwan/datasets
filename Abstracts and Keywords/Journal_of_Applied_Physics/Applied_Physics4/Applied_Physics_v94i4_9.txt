Optical properties of Eu3+ ions in oxyfluoride glasses and glass ceramics doped with two different concentrations, 0.1 and 1 mol
%, have been analyzed and compared with previous results for higher concentrated samples, 2.5 mol
%. The Eu3+ ions in the 0.1 mol
% doped glass ceramics are diluted into like crystalline environments with higher symmetry and lower coupled phonon energy than in the precursor glasses; meanwhile in the 1 mol
% doped glass ceramics the presence of EuF3 clusters has been observed in addition to diluted ions. Fluorescence line narrowing measurements indicate the presence of two main fluoride site distributions for the diluted Eu3+ ions in both glass ceramics. © 2003 American Institute of Physics.
