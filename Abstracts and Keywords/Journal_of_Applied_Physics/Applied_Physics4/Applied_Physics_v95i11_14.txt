We have found that various Mn oxides have the universal resistivity and thermopower in the high temperature limit. The resistivities and thermopowers of all the samples go toward constant values of 7±1	m©
cm and 79±3	¼V/K, which are independent of carrier density and crystal structures. We propose that the electric conduction occurs in a highly localized way in the high temperature limit, where the exchange of entropy and charge occurs in the neighboring Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.
