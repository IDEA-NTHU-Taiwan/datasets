The dynamics of polarization switching have been investigated over extremely broad time (108&lt;t&lt;102	s) and field ranges for hard, soft, and relaxor ferroelectrics based on aliovalent modified Pb(Zr1xTix)O3. The results unambiguously demonstrate important differences in the polarization switching mechanism for these various types of ferroelectrics. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.
