The authors propose a microlevel theory of damage accumulation in polymeric materials. On the basis of experimental data on submicro- and microcracks, they relate the time-dependent strength distribution in polymeric materials under applied load to the distribution of the largest cluster size in a site percolation lattice well below the percolation threshold ¡c. The empty sites fraction ¡ in the percolation lattice is suggested to increase with a constant rate, evaluated using the model of a trigger-type molecular reaction described in the literature. Duxburys initial study of the largest cluster size distribution is extended by Monte Carlo simulations. While the latter distribution is confirmed to be double exponential, the characteristic largest cluster size (the distribution mode) is found to increase exponentially with ¡ within the range ¡0&lt;¡j¡c, ¡0 being a constant, although for small ¡&lt;¡0 the conventional logarithmic dependence is preferable. For the considered two-dimensional square lattice ¡0 is estimated to be 0.05. A failure criterion is formulated and a constitutive framework for the derivation of the time-dependent strength distribution and the structural reliability is defined. The lifetime statistics for a constant enhanced load is shown to be of the Weibull type, while for low loads a triple-exponential distribution is suggested. Unlike the competitive theories, the proposed model predicts that the Weibull shape parameter depends on the applied load by a simple inverse power law with the power defined by a fractal dimension of the critical microcrack aggregate. This prediction is confirmed based on two experimental sets of lifetime statistics, reported in the literature. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.
