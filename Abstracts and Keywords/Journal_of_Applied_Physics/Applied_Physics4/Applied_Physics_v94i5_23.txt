We investigate the performance of n-type GaAs plasmon emitters with surface layers grown by low-temperature molecular-beam epitaxy. The emitters have as-grown Be-doped low-temperature-grown GaAs layers on the top surface, which radiate terahertz transients with a power four times greater than reference emitters without low-temperature-grown (LTG) GaAs layers. The power generated by the structures with low-temperature-grown GaAs layers shows much weaker saturation at large excitation densities. The mechanism of the surface field screened by photoexcited holes has been discussed to explain the negative dip in the THz wave form when the emitter is coated by a LTG GaAs layer. © 2003 American Institute of Physics.
