YBa2Cu3O7 epitaxial film quality has reached a stage where rf applications at T}80
K are carried through. Higher-operating temperatures or better power handling are very much desired. Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 (TBCCO) is an excellent candidate with its higher-transition temperature TcH100105
K. We study the rf field dependence of surface impedance Zs of epitaxial TBCCO films using dielectric resonators with TE011-modes at 8.5 and 15.3 GHz at 4.2

(n=1,2) dependencies together with ratios r(T)=´Xs/´Rs<110 hint to hysteresis losses of Josephson fluxons enhanced by slits or holes in the films. © 2003 American Institute of Physics.
