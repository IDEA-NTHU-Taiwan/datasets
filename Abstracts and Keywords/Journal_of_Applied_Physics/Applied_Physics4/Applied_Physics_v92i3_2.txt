A catalyst powder was prepared by adsorption precipitation of iron acetate on a SiO2 support at a controlled pH. The selective reduction of this powder in a N2/C2H2 atmosphere at 700
°C generates multiwall carbon nanotubes. The study by x-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy of the catalyst and reduced powders reveals that hematite particles with a 820 nm size range are involved in the formation of these carbon nanotubes and end up as Fe3C after the catalysis process. Moreover, coalescence upon reduction produces large particles responsible for the formation of a minor proportion of large tubes of the order of 100 nm in diameter. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.
