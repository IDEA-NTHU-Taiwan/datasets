We present the development of a Raman spectroscopy technique for the measurement of the tensorial nature of stress in silicon on a micrometric scale. After the detailed description of the theoretical bases of the experiment, we measure the stress tensor of a silicon surface close to a scratch. Then, we apply this method to discern which models are suitable for the description of the stress tensor in shallow trench isolations for microelectronics. © 2003 American Institute of Physics.
