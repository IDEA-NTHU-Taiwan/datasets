We consider the stationary characteristics and high-frequency conductance of dual-gate field-effect transistors with a substantially inhomogeneous capacitive connection between gates and a current-conducting channel for an electron enhancement control mode. In most cases, such transistors are quasihomogeneous because their stationary JV-characteristics are not different from characteristics of perfectly homogeneous devices, which can be described by a certain effective channel length. But a nonstationary small-signal conductance of such transistors with the same stationary characteristics can be noticeably different since it is dependent on detailed space distributions of the capacitive inhomogeneity. In particular, a high-frequency gate current can depend on the stationary current direction in channels with symmetrical stationary characteristics. We discuss in detail the cases when a specific channel-gate capacitance increases or decreases monotonically along the channel current direction. Then high-frequency gate currents depend substantially on the stationary channel current direction (in spite of the same stationary JV-characteristics for both directions).
