We study CoFeAl2O3 multilayers, varying from granular to continuous structure with CoFe nominal thickness (10}t}18). Structural percolation takes place at t=tcH18, changing from activated to metallic conductance. A sharp anomaly in ac coercivity of magneto-optical Kerr effect and in magnetization M by superconducting quantum interferometer device is found at t=t*H17, interpreted as transition from superferromagnetism (by dipolar coupled CoFe clusters) to exchange ferromagnetism. Onset at t=t* of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) is attributed to skew scattering of bandlike electrons within giant fractal clusters. These structures may cause the observed Barkhausen noises in M and AMR at tHt*, disappearing at t&gt;t*.
