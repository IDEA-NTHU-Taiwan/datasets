Cathode luminescence and x-ray excited luminescence are recorded on Sm-, Eu-, and Gd-doped CdWO4 single crystal surfaces. Luminescence spectra are convoluted to three species at 2.85, 2.54, and 2.22 eV. Yellow cathode luminescence (2.22 eV) is pronounced on a Sm-doped CdWO4 single crystal at room temperature whereas there is no difference in x-ray activated luminescence from pure CdWO4. The effects of impurities are elucidated with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Significant stress is observed in the Sm-doped CdWO4 single crystal. Electron transfer easily occurs in a Gd-doped CdWO4 single crystal to reduce W and Cd ions. Band structures of Sm-, Eu-, and Gd-doped CdWO4 single crystals are elucidated and compared with pure CdWO4. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.
