Millimeter-wave microscopy is investigated with the aid of a simplified model. The model consists of a parallel plate waveguide opening into a ground plane and radiating in the presence of a perfectly conducting strip. The method of moments is used together with a quasi-static approximation to solve for the reflection coefficient. Numerical results included indicate that high resolutions are feasible with this apparatus. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.
