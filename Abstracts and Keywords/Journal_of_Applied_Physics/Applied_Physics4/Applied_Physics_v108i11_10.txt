The inverse spin-Hall effect, conversion of a spin current into electromotive force, has been investigated in a simple Ni81Fe19/Pd film using the spin pumping. In the Ni81Fe19/Pd film, a spin current generated by the spin pumping is converted into an electromotive force using the inverse spin-Hall effect in the Pd layer. From the magnitude of the electromotive force, we estimated the spin-Hall angle for Pd as 0.01. This large spin-Hall angle for Pd is consistent with the prediction from the Gilbert damping enhancement due to the spin pumping. This value will be a crucial piece of information for spintronics device engineering.
