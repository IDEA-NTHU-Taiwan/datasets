Antiferromagnetic FeSn2(001) thin films with different thicknesses and relatively low Néel temperatures were grown on InSb(001)(4×2) surfaces by molecular-beam epitaxy. The Néel temperature could be increased to above room temperature by subsequent thermal annealing. In situ structural characterization was performed by high- and low-energy electron diffraction. The degree of the structural (001) texture as a function of the preparation and annealing conditions was investigated by x-ray diffractometry. The local magnetic properties and the spin structure were studied using 57Fe conversion electron Mössbauer spectroscopy (CEMS) at different temperatures. The epitaxial FeSn2(001) thin films exhibit in-plane Fe spin orientation and appear to be suitable antiferromagnets for studying the interfacial spin structure in exchange-biased bilayers by CEMS. © 2003 American Institute of Physics.
