An enhancement of the giant magnetoresistance effect is investigated in spin valves where oxide layers, which are formed from magnetic layers, are incorporated in the structure. Information about CoFe based nanooxide layer (NOL) is obtained via x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. Cross-section transmission electron microscopy is also used to explore the effect of an NOL on the polycrystalline structure of the spin valve. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.
