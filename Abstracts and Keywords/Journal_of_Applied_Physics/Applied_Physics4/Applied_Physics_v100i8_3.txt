Structural phase transformations of [111] electric field cooled (FC) Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O30.30PbTiO3 crystals have been performed by x-ray diffraction. A phase sequence of cubic (C)’tetragonal (T)’orthorhombic (O)’monoclinic (M) was found in the FC condition. The finding of a = b&gt;c demonstrates that the M phase is of the MB type.
