Electrical characterization of AlN/GaN interfaces was carried out by the capacitancevoltage (CV) technique in materials grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. The high-frequency CV characteristics showed clear deep-depletion behavior at room temperature, and the doping density derived from the slope of 1/C2 plots under the deep depletion condition agreed well with the growth design parameters. A low value of interface state density Dit of 1×1011
cm2
eV1 or less around the energy position of Ec0.8
eV was demonstrated, in agreement with an average Dit value estimated from photoassisted CV characteristics. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.
