We describe an optical technique using divergent laser beams and sample scanning for measuring electric-field distributions in the spaces between interdigital electrodes. We present experimental results using a LiNbO3 sample and compare them to calculated electric-field distributions. The basic structure of the fields and the locations of the maxima show excellent agreement between experiment and theory. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.
