Single-point magnetic resonance imaging is applied to study the freezing behavior of white cement paste with and without a Ca(NO2)2 based corrosion inhibitor. Pore size distributions are determined from consideration of the evaporable water content. This represents a unique study into the effect of a corrosion inhibitor on the final cement product. It is found that with the addition of a Ca(NO2)2 based corrosion inhibitor a significant reduction of pores between 3 and 10 nm results, producing a considerably coarser pore structure. A dramatic increase in capillary pores of radii larger than 30 nm is also observed in the cement with the inhibitor and is expected to lead to an increased movement of corrosive agents into the concrete when compared to concrete without the corrosion inhibitor. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.
