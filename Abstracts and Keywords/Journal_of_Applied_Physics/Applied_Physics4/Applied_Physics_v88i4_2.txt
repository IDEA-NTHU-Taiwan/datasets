A solution methodology is presented in this article to compute the effective permittivity for a multiphase lattice of dielectric and/or conducting spheres at low frequencies. It is assumed that the lattice is effectively isotropic. This methodology relies on two central developments. The first is a T-matrix solution for a multiphase lattice of spheres immersed in a uniform electric field. This solution is presented in a succinct matrix-vector notation and is valid for any lattice type. The second development is a simple and accurate equation for the effective permittivity that incorporates all mutual coupling between the spheres. Results are shown in this article for three situations. The first is a two-phase system of conducting spheres (used for verification) and the second is a dielectric-conductor (cermet composite) lattice of spheres. The third and final result is from a lattice containing a cluster of conducting spheres. It is suggested that this last material type displays a behavior in between that of random materials and two-phase lattices due to permittivity enhancement at low volume fraction. It is also shown that the Maxwell Garnett formula is not nearly as accurate for this cluster lattice, also because of this enhancement effect. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.
