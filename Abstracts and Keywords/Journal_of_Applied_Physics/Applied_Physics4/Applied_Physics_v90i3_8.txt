The plume generated by a pulsed XeCl laser from a novel nanostructured YBaCuO target (n target) is investigated by methods of optical emission spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. While the spectral positions of the emission lines are the same, stronger line intensities, pertinent to higher kinetic energy of the particles, are observed in the plumes generated from the n target than from a target having micron size grains (m target). The size of small clusters captured on Si plates assembled inside the plume grows in directions perpendicular to the axis of the plume. As shown by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy investigations, in the particles deposited on a SrTiO3 substrate at Ts=700
°C in oxygen the correct 1-2-3 composition is achieved. The average ratio of the heights of the particles deposited from the n target and from the m target is hn/hm=0.6, both in the plume and on SrTiO3. This can explain the smoothness of YBaCuO films prepared by laser deposition from the n targets. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.
