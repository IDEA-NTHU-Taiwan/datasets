Electron transport in a quantum waveguide containing a finite length superlattice (SL) with periodically modulated potentials or Gaussian envelope modulation in magnetic fields is investigated with use of the scattering matrix method. When the modulated potential of the SL takes a Gaussian function, we found that the resonant peaks in conductance at zero field are prominently smoothed out and the conductance spectrum exhibits a monotonically increasing line with a finite rise at the beginning. The corresponding one-dimensional structure presents flat minibands and minigaps. When electron energy is aligned with the miniband, electrons are allowed to pass through the SL to be nearly unscattered. When applying magnetic fields, the conductance plateaus are observed again. From the analyses of the individual modal transmission probabilities, the conductance spectra can be understood well. It is expected that implanting a finite length SL with different modulation potentials may provide a way to tailor conductance spectrum to match the practical demands in devices. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.
