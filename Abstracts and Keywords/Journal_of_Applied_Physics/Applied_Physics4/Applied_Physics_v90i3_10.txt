We report the results of magnetization and 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements performed in the temperature range 5300 K on composites containing ironoxide nanoparticles encased in polystyrene type resins. After carrying out a suitable field treatment in order to decouple the particles from the matrix, a fraction of the particles freely rotate in response to an applied magnetic field. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.
