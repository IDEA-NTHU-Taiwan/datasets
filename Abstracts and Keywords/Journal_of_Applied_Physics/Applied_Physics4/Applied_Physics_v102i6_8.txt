The effect of nitrogen ion implantation has been examined in transparent surfaces of CR-39 polymer. Samples were implanted with 100keV N+ ions to various doses ranging from 1014to1017cm2. The chemical and structural changes in the implanted specimens were performed using Raman spectroscopy and glancing angle x-ray diffraction. Ultraviolet-visible absorption analysis indicates a drastic decline in optical band gap from 3.50eV in virgin sample to 0.80eV at an implantation dose of 1017ions	cm2.
