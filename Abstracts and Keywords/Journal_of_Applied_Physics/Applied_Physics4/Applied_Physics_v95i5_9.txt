Magnetostrictive and piezoelectric laminate composites of terfenol-D and Pb(Zr1xTix)O3 have been studied. The magnetoelectric (ME) coefficients have been characterized for the different operational modes: (i) a longitudinally magnetized and transversely polarized longitudinal transverse (LT) mode, and (ii) a transversely magnetized and transversely polarized transversetransverse (TT) mode. The results demonstrate that the (LT) magnetoelectric mode has dramatically higher ME coefficients than the TT one. The LT magnetoelectric coefficient is up to 57 times larger than the TT one, when operated in low magnetic bias ranges. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.
