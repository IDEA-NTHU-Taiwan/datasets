Thin films of Fe75Zr25 alloy were deposited by cosputtering of Fe and Zr targets using magnetron sputtering technique in the thickness range of 785nm. It was found that at a critical thickness of about 40nm, nanocrystallization of initially deposited amorphous phase takes place. A crossover occurs in the growth exponent (²) upon nanocrystallization giving a direct evidence for different growth behavior for amorphous and nanocrystalline phases.
