Two possible types of cadmium sulphide (CdS) nanostructures can be formed within LangmuirBlodgett (LB) films of calixarene Cd salt as a result of exposure to H2S gas: nanoclusters with the size of about 1.5 nm or two-dimensional planes with the thickness of about 1.7 nm. Transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction studies on calixarene/CdS LB films show that CdS particles are not present in the fresh samples at the beginning, but they are gradually formed under exposure to a high energy electron beam. A blueshift of the first exciton absorption band and an increase of the extinction coefficient, caused by exposure to H2S gas, were found with UV-visible optical spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance, respectively. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.
