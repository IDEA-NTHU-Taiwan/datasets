This study proposes ideas for simultaneous mixing and pumping using asymmetric microelectrode arrays. The driving force of the mixing and pumping was based on electroosmotic flows induced by alternating current (ac) electric fields on asymmetric microelectrodes. The key idea was to bend/incline the microelectrodes like diagonal/herringbone shapes. Four patterns of the asymmetric electrode arrays were considered depending on the shape of electrode arrays. For the diagonal shape, repeated and staggered patterns of the electrode arrays were studied. For the herringbone shape, diverging and converging patterns were examined. These microelectrode patterns forced fluid flows in the lateral direction leading to mixing and in the channel direction leading to pumping. Three-dimensional numerical simulations were carried out using the linear theories of ac electro-osmosis. The performances of the mixing and pumping were assessed in terms of the mixing efficiency and the pumping flow rate. The results indicated that the helical flow motions induced by the electrode arrays play a significant role in the mixing enhancement. The pumping performance was influenced by the slip velocity at the center region of the channel compared to that near the side walls.
