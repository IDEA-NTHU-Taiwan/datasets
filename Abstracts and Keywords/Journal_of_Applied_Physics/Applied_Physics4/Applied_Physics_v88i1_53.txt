We report magnetization measurements in the Ln(Mn1xCox)O3+» (Ln=Eu,
Nd; 0}x&lt;1) and Y(Mn1xCox)O3 (0.35}x}0.5) perovskites as a function of temperature and magnetic field. Compositions in the range of 0.35}x}0.8 (Ln=Eu), 0.4}x}0.6 (Ln=Nd), and 0.35}x}0.45 (Ln=Y) exhibit metamagnetic behavior associated with a transformation of the magnetic structure from ferrimagnetic, where the magnetic moments of Co2+ and Mn4+ ions are antiparallel, to ferromagnetic where they are parallel. A ferromagnetic state is observed for the 0.1}x}0.15 (Ln=Nd) and 0.45&lt;x}0.5 (Ln=Y) compositions. Doping and H-T phase diagrams are presented, and these diagrams resemble those of Ln1xCaxMnO3 charge-ordered manganites. Neutron diffraction studies indicate site ordering of the Co and Mn ions in the Y(Co0.5Mn0.5)O3 system, which is presumably responsible for its ferromagnetic behavior. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.
