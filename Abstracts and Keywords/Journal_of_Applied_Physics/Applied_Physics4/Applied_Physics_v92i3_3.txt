Cuprous oxide quantum particles as small as 2 nm (comparable to the Bohr exciton radius) were synthesized using an electrochemical route. Quantum confinement effects are evident from a blueshift in the optical absorption. The optical absorption spectra of Cu2O nanoparticles of different sizes are discussed. Structural analysis by x-ray diffraction as well as electron diffraction shows the nanoparticles to be cubic and single phased Cu2O. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies indicate the presence of CuO on the surface of Cu2O core nanoparticles. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.
