The temperature distribution during meltingrecrystallization processing of thin silicon films for electronic devices was calculated numerically and is presented in graphical form. Two methods of highquality recrystallization are analyzed: the antireflective coating method and the stepwise thickness variation of the silicon dioxide. The controlling parameters were determined and their effects on temperature distributions are presented.
