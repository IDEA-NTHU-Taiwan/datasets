The ultrasonic harmonic generation technique has been used to extend measurement of the nonlinearity parameters of copper to 3	°K. Comparison of these data and combinations of truly adiabatic thirdorder elastic (TOE) constants with predictions of simplified models show that a central force, nearest neighbor model accounts reasonably well for the behavior of copper in the regions of 45 and 200	°K and less well at other regions. The central force, nearest neighbor model also gives a good qualitative explanation for the temperature dependence of the combinations of TOE constants that are measured in this investigation.
