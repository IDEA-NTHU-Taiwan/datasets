A thin, amorphous LiAlF4 film, with lithium ion conductivity of 1×104 S/m at 25	°C, has been prepared by vacuum evaporation. Utilizing this thin film as a solid electrolyte, an ITO/WO3/LiAlF4/LiIn overlayer has been constructed (ITO: indiumtinoxide). For it, the electrochromism of WO3 due to lithium ion injection was observed.
