nCdTe/pCuInSe2 heterojunctions were fabricated by flash evaporating pCuInSe2 on indiumdoped CdTe single crystals. IV characteristics and the photospectral response of the heterojunctions were studied. On illumination appreciable change in the IV characteristics and photovoltaic effects were observered. A theoretical energyband diagram for the heterojunction was constructed, and the theoretical and experimental barrier potentials were compared.
