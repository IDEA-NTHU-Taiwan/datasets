Cd3P2 thin films have been deposited on glass substrates by electron beam evaporation technique. The amorphous asdeposited films, after annealing in vacuum in the temperature range 180200	°C, developed the crystallinity. Such polycrystalline films exhibited preferential orientation along the (224	400) direction. The films indicated ntype conductivity with resistivity value around 1.6 ©	cm at room temperature. The composition, ionicity, and Madelung constant, calculated from xray photoelectron spectroscopy data, are Cd3P1.7, 0.08, and 1.68, respectively. From the optical (R and T) and modulation (derivative) spectra, the different parameters, namely, refractive index (n<3.83), band gap (Eg=0.61 eV), band splitting parameters (crystal field ”CF=0.03 eV, spinorbit ”0=0.08 eV) have been obtained. Photoluminescence emission related to bandtoband transition is observed around 0.51 eV.
