The nature of the atomic structure and the characteristics of both line and planar defects in decagonal quasicrystals of ascast Al62Cu20Co15Si3 were studied by means of conventional diffraction contrast and highresolution electron microscopy. Two types of dislocations were observed. The magnitude and direction of the Burgers vector of type A dislocations and the Burgers vector direction of type B dislocations were determined. The direction of the displacement vector of the planar faults was defined.
