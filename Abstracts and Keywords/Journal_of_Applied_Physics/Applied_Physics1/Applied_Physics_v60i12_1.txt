We report on the observation of a morphological defect structure, crosshatch and the experimental circumstances that lead to its occurence during GaAs homoepitaxy. Photoluminescence, xray diffraction and transmission electron miscroscopy (TEM) results obtained on crosshatched samples are presented and discussed in regards to the nature and origin of the defect structure.
