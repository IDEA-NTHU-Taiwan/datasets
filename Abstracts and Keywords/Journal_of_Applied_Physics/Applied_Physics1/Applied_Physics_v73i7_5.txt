The absolute intensity of nearultraviolet emission from a neon Zpinch plasma is measured with a timegated, twodimensional optical multichannel analyzer (OMA). The OMA provides spatial and spectral resolution with a 100 ns gate duration. Spatially resolved continuum emission, Ne	viii line emission, and Ne	viii lineprofile measurements are used to determine the pinch diameter, the density of the neon plasma, and the Ne	viii 3p level population.
