Ga0.47In0.53AsInP multiquantum wells grown by lowpressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition on garnet (GGG=Gd3Ga5O12 with a=12.383 Å) substrates are presented for the first time. The xray diffraction pattern shows that the orientation of the epitaxial layer is (111) while the underlying substrate orientation is (100). The photoluminescence at 77 K is due to the GaInAs layers.
