The expression for the optimum phase matching angle for the biaxial crystal KTiOPO4 (KTP) is presented and numerically calculated. The theoretical effective nonlinear coefficient, walkoff angle, and conversion efficiency are determined. The results provide some theoretical and practical guidance for optimum operation of biaxial crystals, with specific numerical calculations for KTP.
