The implant isolation characteristics of highly doped n and ptype GaAs epitaxial layers implanted with 5 MeV O+ ions are reported. High (<108 ©/) sheet resistances are obtained in such layers following annealing at 550600	°C for ion doses around 1015 cm2. The residual conductivity is still due to hopping processes with small activation (5070 meV) energies. The use of a single MeV O+ implant considerably simplifies the isolation of GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) structures relative to the usual multipleimplant keV energy scheme. Small geometry (2×5 ¼m2) HBTs with gains of 25 for highlydoped (p=7×1019 cm3) base layer structures have been fabricated using MeV implant isolation.
