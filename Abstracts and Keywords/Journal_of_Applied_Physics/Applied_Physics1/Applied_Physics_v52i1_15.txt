The strong transient optical absorption in nInSb Raman spinflip laser device at 2	°K was interpreted due to the intense lasergenerated hot conduction electrons. We present the microscopic theoretical calculation for this nonlinear and nonequilibrium optical effect. By assuming the timedependent functions for electronic temperature and Fermi energy, the time evolution of the nonequilibrium hot electron distribution during the pulsed laser irradiation is calculated.
