The output signal in a deeplevel transient spectroscopy experiment is a function of both the ratewindow settings and sample temperature. Usually, the rate window is held fixed and the temperature scanned to produce the deeplevel spectrum. We will demonstrate that a deeplevel spectrum can also be obtained by fixing the temperature and scanning the rate window.
