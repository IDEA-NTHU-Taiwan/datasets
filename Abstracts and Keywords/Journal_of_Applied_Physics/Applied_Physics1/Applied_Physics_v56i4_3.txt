The stationary Boltzmann equation is solved by using a matrix method. This allows determining directly the steady state regime for hot carriers in semiconductors. The main advantages of this new method are: the result does not depend on initial conditions, and the cost is much lower than that of iterative or Monte Carlo techniques, particularly at high electric field.
