Flash xray measurements have been made on GaAs metal semiconductor field effect transistor structures fabricated in both Crdoped and undoped semiinsulating substrate material in order to characterize the levels responsible for long term transients in these devices. Prominent electron and hole traps with activation energies in the 0.760.90eV range have been identified. The main electron trap, which is present in both Crdoped and undoped substrates, appears to be primarily responsible for the observed transient response. However, traps related to Crdoping also contribute to the transient behavior.
