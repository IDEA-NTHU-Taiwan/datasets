A monolithic surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator operating at 156 MHz, in which the frequency controlling element is a FabryPerot type of SAW resonator and the gain element is a monolithic SAW amplifier (SiOx/InSb/SiOx structure located inside the SAW resonator cavity) is described and experimental details presented. Based on the existing experimental data, an uhf monolithic ring resonator oscillator is proposed.
