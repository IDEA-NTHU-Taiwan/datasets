Electronic charge trapping in the lowpressure chemically vapor deposited thin film of Si3N4 has been investigated by internal photoelectriceffect technique. Chargestorage characteristics and the spatial distribution of electrons trapped in the Si3N4 layer of a biased AlSi3N4SiO2Si structure have been determined using photocurrent and highfrequency CV measurements. Electrons generated by internal photoemission at the Si surface were captured by traps located within the Si3N4 layer which gave rise to a chargestorage mechanism. Some of these trapped charges were then photoionized by photons with an energy of 4.14 eV and removed from the insulator. This resulted in a discharging mechanism. The flatband voltage shifts for various charging and discharging processes were determined and characterized in detail. The total trapped electronic charge was on the order of 3.14×1012/cm2, with a retention time of 48 days in the dark. The etchback experiments, where the charged Si3N4 layer was etched back in steps, determined the distribution of the trapped electronic charge across the Si3N4 film of the metalnitrideoxide semiconductor structure. The midfilm concentration of these trapped electrons was 2.8×1017/cm3.
