Analyzing the results measured by xray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersion xray analysis, and the standard fourprobe techniques for eight groups of samples with different compositions of excess CaO and CuO, after quenching and annealing, shows that not only the much more stable 2223 phase in the Bi(Pb)SrCaCuO system was obtained in a high fraction, but also its grain (plate shaped) size could be made larger than normally sintered. We attribute these effects to the annealing and/or the excess contents of CaO and CuO selected in this study.
