We made a direct comparison between amorphous and crystalline Ge surfaces exposed to equal amounts of activated oxygen. On amorphous Ge we found a larger average number of oxygen atoms around each oxidized substrate atom than on crystalline Ge. Similar conclutions were reached for the oxidation of crystalline and amorphous Si.
