A new chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method for the production of amorphous silicon films from SiF2 gas is described. About 1% (atomic) fluorine is incorporated in the film, its concentration decreasing with increasing deposition temperature. Optical, electronic, and structural properties of the films are reported.
