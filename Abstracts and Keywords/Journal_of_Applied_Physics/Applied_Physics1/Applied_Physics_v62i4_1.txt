Thermal oxidation of singlecrystal ptype CdTe has been carried out in dry and wet oxygen. The thickness of the oxide varies as the square root of oxidation time, implying a diffusion controlled process. The activation energy for thermal oxidation is 1.2 eV. Examination of the oxide by Auger electron spectroscopy, xray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy shows that the composition of thick layers is CdTeO3; thin layers less than 100 Å thick may differ slightly in composition. An oxygen gradient is detected in asgrown thin oxides, but with storage in air at room temperature the oxygen gradient disappears. Values of chemical shift of the xray photoelectron spectroscopy peaks for the cadmiumtelluriumoxygen ternary system are clarified.
