InGaAsP/InP 1.3¼m laser material grown by liquidphase epitaxy occasionally exhibits an anomalous xray diffraction pattern and may also have a high threshold current density. The origin of this effect is shown to be the contamination of the normal ptype InP cladding layer with Ga and As. A typical composition of this quaternary cladding layer is determined, and secondaryion massspectrometry analyses are used to show the contamination is most likely caused by pullover from the previous melt.
