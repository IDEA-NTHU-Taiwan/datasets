An expression for load for maximum power transfer from a real solar cell, having resistive and current leakage losses, has been obtained using Lagranges method of undetermined multipliers for solving the transcendental currentvoltage relationship. The theoretical results are compared with the experimental measurements of the optimum load for pn junction solar cells for various illumination levels.
