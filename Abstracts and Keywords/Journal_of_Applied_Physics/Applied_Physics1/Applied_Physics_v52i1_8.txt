The spatial photon intensity distribution is calculated for geometries pertinent to taperedwiggler freeelectron lasers. A largeradius incident photon field interacts with a smallradius ebeam gain medium, and the diffraction of extracted energy from the gain medium to larger radii is analyzed in the limit of small gain. The results are compared with a simple fillfactor approximation.
