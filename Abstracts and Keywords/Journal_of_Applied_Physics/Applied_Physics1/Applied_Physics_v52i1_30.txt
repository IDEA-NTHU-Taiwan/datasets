A new technique for doping GaAs with Sn from a spinon SnO2/SiO2 source is described. Sn is first introduced in the GaAs substrate by a slow thermal ramp. Subsequent diffusion and activation of Sn is accomplished with a cw scanning laser. Results for laser power below and above the melting power of the substrate are presented. Transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction patterns indicate that a chemical reaction involving the formation of a tinarsenide compound occurs during the diffusion process.
