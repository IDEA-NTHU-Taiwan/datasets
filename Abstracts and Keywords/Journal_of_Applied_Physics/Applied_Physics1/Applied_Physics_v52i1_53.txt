A lowtemperature photoluminescence study of bulk polycrystalline InP is presented. The dominant acceptor feature common to all samples at 6 K is a pair band at 1.382 and 1.387 eV, possibly associated with carbon impurity. The temperature dependence of intensity, linewidth, and spectral position of a vacancyimpurity band at 1.078 eV is reported for the first time and compared with predictions of the configurationcoordinate model. In addition, an unusual band at 1.209 eV which is formed over long periods of time at temperatures below 30 K is described.
