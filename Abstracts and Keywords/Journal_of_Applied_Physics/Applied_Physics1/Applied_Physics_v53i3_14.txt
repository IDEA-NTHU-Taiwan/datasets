Two material selective etching solutions have been evaluated for the InGaAsP/InP system. One of these solutions etches the InGaAsPInGaAs alloys and stops at InP, while the other etches InP and stops on the ternary or quaternary alloys. Roomtemperature etch rates were measured for both etches on bulk and liquid phase epitaxial materials.
