Recent optical and photoelectric data of Zn3P2 single crystals are reviewed including measurements of oriented crystals under polarized light. A Zn3P2 bandstructure model is proposed which is based on these results. The influence of tetragonal crystal structure is included in the model as the additional splitoff valence level and two different minima in the conduction band near the “ point.
