Structural and compositional properties of hydrogenated silicontin alloys have been investigated as a function of tin content, sputtering pressure, and presence of hydrogen. Transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive xray microanalysis, and scanning electron microscopy were used to detect compositional and structural inhomogeneities in these materials.
