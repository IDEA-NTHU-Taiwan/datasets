A theoretical analysis is given of the induced current profiles at grain boundaries in polycrystalline solar cells, as obtained by light or electron beam excitation. The area A and the variance Ã2 of the contrast profile of a grain boundary are calculated for realistic generations as functions of the interface recombination velocity vs and the minority carrier diffusion length L. A graphical new procedure is proposed which allows the simultaneous determination of vs and L from the measured values of A and Ã. The evaluation of an experimental electron beam induced current profile illustrates the applicability of the theory.
