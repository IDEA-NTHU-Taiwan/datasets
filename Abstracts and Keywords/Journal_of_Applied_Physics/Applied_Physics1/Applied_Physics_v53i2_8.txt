It is shown that practical beam annealing of silicon can be accomplished with a high intensity arc lamp. The use of a onedimensional, steadystate solution for temperature is justified. The Kirchhoff transform is utilized to include the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity. Surface temperatures produced by a xenon arc lamp are calculated for 300 and 375¼m thick silicon samples, using substrate temperatures of 350 and 500	°C. It is shown that substantial reduction of the radiation intensity required for a given surface temperature can be obtained by placing a quartz wafer between the silicon sample and the heat sink.
