Superconducting BaPb1xBixO3 (BPB) thin films have been epitaxially grown on sapphire (0112) and SrTiO3 (100) singlecrystal substrates at around 700	°C by the planar rf magnetron sputtering method, under relatively high pressure ArO2 mixed gas atmosphere. Assputtered BPB films on SrTiO3 (100) exhibit superconductivity with a sharp transition at Tc=10 K. The resistivity, 8×104 ©	cm, is more than one order of magnitude smaller, and the critical current, 2.5×105 A/cm2, is more than two orders of magnitude larger than those reported earlier. The Hall mobility is 3.0 cm2/V	s. The films are confirmed to be single crystals directly by the absence of grain boundary Josephson junctions, which polycrystalline BPB inherently possesses, as well as by the xray diffraction and the reflection electron diffraction analysis.
