An attempt has been made to identify the optimum parameters for good dielectric resonator materials. The dependence of dielectric constant of the system BaLn2Ti4O12 (Ln=La, Pr, Nd, Sm) on packing fraction and nephelauxetic ratio is discussed. The reported dielectric data for this system were treated using the multiregression method.
