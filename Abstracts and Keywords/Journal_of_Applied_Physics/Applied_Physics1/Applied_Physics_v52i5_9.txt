The change of the elastic constant c44 of Si is theoretically investigated in the presence of both free electrons and bound electrons. While in ptype semiconductors the boundhole contribution to the change of the elastic constant c44 is qualitatively different from the freehole contribution, the boundelectron contribution in ntype Si is essentially identical to the freeelectron contribution. It is shown that this phenomenon results from the facts that the donor ground state of silicon is a singlet and that the six conduction valleys of silicon are uniformly lowered by a shear acoustic wave.
