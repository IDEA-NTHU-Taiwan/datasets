Techniques for making electron transverse velocity measurements on an intense electron beam using thicktarget bremsstrahlung emission are presented. The procedure presented here differs from similar previous measurements using thicktarget bremsstrahlung in that it allows both time and spatial resolution. Data from the study of a 2.1MeV, 40kA, 140nslong beam are presented. Measurements on this beam had a transverse velocity resolution of about 0.1 c. The temporal resolution was about 5 ns and the spatial resolution was 6 mm. Techniques used to determine the timeresolved radial current density profile are also presented.
