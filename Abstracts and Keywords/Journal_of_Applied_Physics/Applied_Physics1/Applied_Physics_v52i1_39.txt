The addition of a thin, high bandgap P(N)type AlxGa1xAs layer into a conventional AlyGa1yAsGaAs Np (Pn) heterojunction is found to significantly reduce the 2kT recombination current, thereby permitting the bulk diffusion current to dominate at current densities as low as <105 A/cm2. Experiment indicates that the 2kT current is due to surfacerecombination processes and originates in a very narrow region near the pn junction, presumably due to the small minoritycarrier surfacediffusion length.
