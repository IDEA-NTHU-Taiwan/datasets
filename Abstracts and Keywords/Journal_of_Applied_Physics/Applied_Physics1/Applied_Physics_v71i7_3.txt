The surface of PbTiO3 films prepared by the solgel method was analyzed by the use of xray photoelectron spectra combined with secondaryion mass spectra and infrared absorption spectra. The results suggested that traces of organic materials still existed at least in the surface layer of the films. The outmost surface was partly covered by adsorbed oxygen. The surface layer of the film deviated from stoichiometry because of the shortage of Ti; the thickness of it was estimated about 400 Å.
