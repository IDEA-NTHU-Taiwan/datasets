A transmission electron microscopy study of sintered NdFeB magnets after annealing above 650	°C shows the formation of a thin intergranular Ndrich layer extending to pockets of polycrystalline fcc Nd crystals. The grain boundary phase acts as a pinning site for the magnetic domain walls and is necessary for good magnetic hardening. On the other hand, the Nd1+õFe4B4 phase is an unavoidable product of the sintering process but need not be present for good coercivity.
