Synthetic crystals of layered titanium silver were grown epitaxially by vapor deposition techniques. The motivation was to generate a onedimensional diffraction grating to be used as a soft xray monochromator. The structural analysis shows that the asgrown film is almost a single crystal, where a new phase is present, characteristic of the layering process. The results indicate that it is now becoming feasible to produce new synthetic crystals by vapor deposition of two chemically quite dissimilar metals.
