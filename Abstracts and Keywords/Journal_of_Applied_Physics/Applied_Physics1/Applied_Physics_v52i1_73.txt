Films with modulated composition 8Å Cu/8Å Ni show an increase in the Youngs and torsional moduli of a factor of 2, relative to bulk or longerwavelength samples. The film structure is found to be highly textured with coherent lamella for the shortwavelengthenhanced moduli samples, but becomes more random with the probable introduction of misfit dislocations at longer wavelengths. The moduli results support the previous findings of Tsakalakos and Hilliard.
