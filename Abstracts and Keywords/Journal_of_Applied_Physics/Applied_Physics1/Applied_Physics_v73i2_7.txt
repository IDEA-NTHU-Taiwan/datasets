Annealing of defects introduced by neutron transmutation doping of floatzone silicon has been investigated by positron lifetime spectroscopy and Dopplerbroadening measurements. It is shown that the main defects anneal out at about 150 and 500	°C. During annealing, the formation of bigger defect complexes can be seen.
