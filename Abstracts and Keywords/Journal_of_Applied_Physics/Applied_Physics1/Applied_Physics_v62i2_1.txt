Coherent electron microdiffraction patterns have been obtained from a new crystalline precipitate found in silicon wafers annealed at 635	°C for 256 h. On the basis of the experimental evidence presented, the most likely structure is that of keatite (SiO2, tetragonal). The implications for the study of oxygen precipitation in silicon are discussed.
