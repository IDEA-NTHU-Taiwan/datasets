MgO crystals intentionally doped with Al were characterized by analytical electron microscopic examinations and positron lifetime measurements. Large spinel (MgO Al2O3) precipitates were observed in samples with high contents of Al. A welldefined crystallographic relationship between the precipitates and the matrix was found. The characteristics of positron lifetime spectra appear to depend on the valence state of the different impurities in the MgO lattice suggesting that positrons are trapped by vacancy impurity complexes.
