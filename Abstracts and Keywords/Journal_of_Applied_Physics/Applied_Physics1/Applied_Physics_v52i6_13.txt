The comment by Baixeras et al. [J. Appl. Phys. 52, 4330 (1981)] on the recent paper by Migliori [J. Appl. Phys. 51, 3439 (1980)] utilizes counterexamples not consistent with Miglioris premise. Baixeras et al. also fail to support their contention that in two dimensions it is possible, if more difficult, to solve a general critical state model with boundary conditions.
