We show that spacecharge injection from a needle into a dielectric can be determined with a resolution of 1015 °C, by using guarded needle electrodes and a charge compensating bridge circuit. The technique is applied to epoxy resin samples. A welldefined homogeneous spacecharge cloud formation is observed in quantitative agreement with a fieldlimiting spacecharge concept.
