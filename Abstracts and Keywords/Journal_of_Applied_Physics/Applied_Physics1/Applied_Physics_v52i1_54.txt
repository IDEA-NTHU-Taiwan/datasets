When crystalline InP is subjected to mechanical damage by scratching or cleaving in vacuum, a new luminescence transition near 1.3 eV results. The spectrum consists of a doublet split by <5 meV. Thermal quenching occurs above 100 K with an activation energy of 120 meV. Annealing to 300 K in the dark removes the luminescence centers, and the annealing temperature is reduced to about 200 K with illumination. We interpret the luminescence centers as native defects acting as electron traps of depth <100 meV. The defects are believed to be introduced by the process of plastic deformation of the crystal.
