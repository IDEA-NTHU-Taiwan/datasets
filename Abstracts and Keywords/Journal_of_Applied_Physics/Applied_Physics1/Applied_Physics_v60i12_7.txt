Negative ion formation in pure CF4 and CF4/N2 gas mixtures is shown to proceed exclusively by dissociative electron attachment mechanisms at electron energies &gt;4 eV in a highpressure electron swarm experiment. These results are in contrast to a recent swarm study where CF4 was reportedly shown to attach electrons by transient parent anion formation processes at low electron energies õJ0.5 eV. Possible sources of errors in that study are discussed.
