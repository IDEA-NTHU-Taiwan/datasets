General theoretical expressions appropriate to calculating the internal and external quantum efficiency of photoluminescence (PL) are derived for a semiconductor of thickness d and bounded by two surfaces with different surfacerecombination velocities. The external efficiency expected from thin and thick layers is compared and contrasted. Under certain conditions and adopting reasonable assumptions, we indicate how a single measurement of the steadystate PL can yield information about the minoritycarrier diffusion length.
