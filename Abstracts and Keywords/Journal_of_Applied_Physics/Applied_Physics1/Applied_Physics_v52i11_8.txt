Solution to the transport equations in the realm of small signal theory results in expressions for the electric field, and the excess minorityand majoritycarrier densities as functions of distance from an injecting boundary. Two situations are examined for lifetime semiconductors, the trapfree case and the case with monoenergetic traps. With different boundary conditions, the new expressions apply equally to all four nonequilibrium processes: injection, exclusion, accumulation, and extraction. Results on extraction are supported by measurements on singlecrystal Ge, before and after neutron bombardment (to introduce traps).
