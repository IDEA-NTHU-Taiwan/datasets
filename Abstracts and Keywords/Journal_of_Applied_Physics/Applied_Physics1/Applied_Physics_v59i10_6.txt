The incorporation of thallium in molecularbeamepitaxial indium antimonide has been studied by secondaryion mass spectrometry. At temperatures above 300	°C desorption competes with incorporation. Increasing incorporation and surface accumulation is observed below 300	°C. The incorporation rate is also affected by the surface stoichiometry in a manner consistent with thallium occupying indium sublattice sites.
