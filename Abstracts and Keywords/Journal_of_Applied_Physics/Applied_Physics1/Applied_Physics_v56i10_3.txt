Previous work has established that the optical characteristics of Sb2Se3 films are influenced by an amorphouscrystalline transition at 170	°C. This paper comments on the change in optical characteristics in an optical recording material composed of Sb2Se3 and Bi2Te3 layers caused by alloying between the layers above 250	°C.
