In an attempt to clarify the controversial views about the general validity of the rather frequently and successfully used critical state mode, we consider an explicit formulation of this model and present a careful analysis of the boundaries of the regions where the field B is zero. As a result, it seems that the arguments recently published that call into question the general validity of this mode are not acceptable.
