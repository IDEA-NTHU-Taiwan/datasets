A flashlamp of the relaxation type with dissymmetrical thoriated tungsten electrodes is described for generation of intense electrical and light pulses of width as short as 1 ns at high repetition rates. Comprehensive data on the dependence of emission spectra, intensity, and pulse shape on operating parameters as pressure, electrode gap distance, and polarity are presented. The results provide a useful guide for users as well as information on the physics of low ionized plasmas.
