First reports on the characteristics and applications of GeO2SiO2 glass films formed by laserinduced chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are presented. At a low temperature (200300	°C), solid solutions of ternary compounds can be obtained by laserinduced CVD. It is shown that these GeO2SiO2 ternary films were applicable to planar optical waveguides.
