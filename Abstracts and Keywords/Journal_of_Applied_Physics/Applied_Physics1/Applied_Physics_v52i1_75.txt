The resistivity of amorphous alloys is sentitive to their atomic structure. It has been reported recently that there are significant differences in roomtemperature resistivities as a function of wheel speed (which determines ribbon thickness in the technique of rapid quenching from the melt). These results were interpreted as evidence for a variety of amorphous structures. We have found no differences in resistivities of samples of a similar composition as a function of wheel speed. The reasons for this disagreement are unknown.
