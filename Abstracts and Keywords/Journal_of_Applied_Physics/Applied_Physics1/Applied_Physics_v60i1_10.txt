The effects of the orientation of the LiNbO3 samples on the characteristics of planar waveguides fabricated by He+ implantation are presented. They show that the number of extraordinary modes is the same in Y and Zcut samples whereas the Zcut samples support more ordinary modes than do Ycut samples. Also the attenuation of each mode is lower in Zcut material, showing that Zcut material is more suitable for the fabrication of low loss waveguides.
