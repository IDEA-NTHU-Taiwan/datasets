A study of ionimplanted zinc in GaAs has been made using three annealing techniques: ebeam, graphite strip heating, and furnace annealing in an arsine ambient. The highest hole concentrations, 78×1019 cm3, were obtained using electronbeam annealing. Graphite strip heating and electronbeam annealing were able to electrically activate 100% of the implanted dose. The effect of strain on the activation of the zinc has been demonstrated by comparing chemicalvapordeposited Si3N4 with reactively evaporated AlN encapsulants.
