The operating characteristics and scaling parameters of a flashlamppumped, 4mlong IBr laser were investigated to further evaluate its potential as a solarpumped laser. A peak power of 3 kW/cm2 at 2.7 ¼m was achieved at 4Torr IBr pressure. A gain of 0.07 m1 was measured at a maximum capacitor discharge energy of 4 kJ. The threshold input power necessary for lasing was found to decrease by a factor of 4 and the laser pulse width increased fourfold as the active gain length was increased from 1 to 4 m. A maximum pulse width of 120 ¼s was achieved with 10Torr argon diluent added to 4Torr IBr. Quenching of the excited state by the parent molecule was shown to be unimportant for pressures less than 4Torr IBr. An intrinsic efficiency in the range of 12% has been measured for flashlamppumped IBr.
