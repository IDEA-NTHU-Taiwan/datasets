Magnetic leakage fields from nonspherical inclusions in magnetic materials are discussed using classical electromagnetic theory. The model used is that of a prolate or oblate spheroidal inclusion embedded in an infinite medium. Deviations from the leakage field behavior of a spherical inclusion are discussed and procedures are suggested whereby one can test for inclusion shape.
