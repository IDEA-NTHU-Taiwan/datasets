Proton beams with currents ~50 kA at 5 MeV in a r160ns FWHM pulse have been extracted from an ion diode operated on the Aurora pulser. This current corresponds to an efficiency (proton currrent/total current) of 20%, which compares favorably with numerical simulation. The simulation indicates that the ion current is enhanced over the ChildLangmuir value due to increased electron lifetime in the diode. The proton beam directed onto a LiCl target provides a source of 1.8×1012 neutrons/sr/pulse in the forward direction from the 7Li(p,n)	7Be reaction.
