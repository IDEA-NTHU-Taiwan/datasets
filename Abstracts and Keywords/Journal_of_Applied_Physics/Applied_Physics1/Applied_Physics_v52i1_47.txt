Using the threedimensional timedependent neutrondepolarization technique the motion of a 180° domain wall in a (010)[001] pictureframe FeSi (3.5 wt. % Si) single specimen with dimensions 15×10×0.26 mm3 has been studied as a function of the field amplitude of a blockshaped magnetic field. The field ranges from 2 to 40 A/m. The wall velocity and deformation have been measured as a function of the applied field strength and the position of the wall in the crystal. The measurements indicate that up to 27 A/m the wall motion is uniform with a dynamic coercive force of 3±0.5 A/m and wall mobilities of 0.68±0.07 and 0.81±0.08 mm	s1/A	m1, dependent upon the position of the moving wall in the crystal. The measured depolarization owing to wall bowing and wall inclination is less than predicted in the literature for an ideally bowed wall, indicating that imperfections in the crystal cause bowing and tilting on a scale much smaller than the crystal thickness. Nevertheless, the measured critical field above which the wall breaks up and no steadystate motion exists, agrees with the predictions of wall bowing theory.
