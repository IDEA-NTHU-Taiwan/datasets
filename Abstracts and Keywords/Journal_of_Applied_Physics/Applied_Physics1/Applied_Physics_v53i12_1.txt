A new concept for archival electron beam accessed memory has recently been proposed. In the write mode, a high intensity electron beam selectively melts columnar bits in a twodimensional lattice which is supported by a thin membrane. The force of surface tension transforms the melted columns into droplets. In the read mode, a low intensity beam interrogates the bits. Transmission contrast is generated by the difference in crosssectional area of the columnar and spherical bits. We study the relationship between physical target parameters and system performance of such a memory. MonteCarlo simulation of the electron beamtarget interaction has been used to design a target consistent with the following system performance goals: (a) 107 bit/sec data rate, (b) 1010 bit/cm2 data density, and (c) 109 error rate.
