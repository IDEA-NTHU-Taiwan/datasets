In this study we report the results of structural studies of the interfaces between sputterdeposited copper (Cu) thin films and Hg0.8Cd0.2Te, CdTe substrates. In both cases, Cu2Te was formed even though the heat of reaction (”HR) would be positive as determined by calculation of the bulk reaction of Cu thin films with the substrates. This phase may disappear after several hours, gradually leaving a CdTeO3 phase in its place.
