Fieldline reconnection and the behavior of closed fieldline plasma have been studied using a twodimensional Lagrangian code. The effects of fieldline divergence of the pinch end, active and passive mirrors, and laser heating are considered. A physical interpretation of plasma behavior for different experimental techniques is given. These calculations aid in understanding some of the experimental results of Los Alamos and the Kurchatov Institute.
