The optical characteristics of Sb2Se3 and Sb2Te3 films are changed due to an amorphouscrystalline phase transition below 200	°C. The respective reflectivity of 400 Å Sb2Se3 and 300 Å Sb2Te3 films, each on a Te reflective layer, is increased from 10% to 30% and from 45% to 65% by laser radiation. Using these new materials, optical disc recording of FM video signals by a diode laser has been demonstrated.
