Transport and phototransport properties of crystalline indium monoselenide (InSe) doped with a variety of elements are reported. Measured mobilities, lifetimes, and effective diffusion lengths of photoexcited carriers are used to interpret electrical and photovoltaic properties of several different structures. These include pn junctions, bismuth/ptype InSe, platinum/ntype InSe, and indium tin oxyde (ITO)/ptype InSe. External solar efficiencies of the best devices are between 5% and 6%. The influence on the efficiency of the various parameters is evaluated, and ways of improvement are discussed.
