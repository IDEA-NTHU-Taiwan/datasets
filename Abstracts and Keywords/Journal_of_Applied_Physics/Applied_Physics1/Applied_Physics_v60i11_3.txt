Optical and electronic properties of polycrystalline bulk and thinfilm CuInSe2based photoelectrochemical solar cells have been evaluated. The minoritycarrier diffusion length was measured using the surface photovoltage technique and polyiodide electrolyte yielding 1 and 0.8 microns for ntype bulk and thinfilm material, respectively. The first bulk optical absorption data have been obtained from transmission, using thinned samples and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. These confirm high opticalabsorption coefficients (4×105 cm1) away from threshold.
