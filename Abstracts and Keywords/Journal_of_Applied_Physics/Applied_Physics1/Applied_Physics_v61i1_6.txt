A technique for protecting the pn junction of InGaAs planar diodes using thermally evaporated glass films has been developed. A planar diode with a 90¼mdiam diffused junction protected with the glass film had a reverse current less than 1 nA at 20 V. The diode showed low reverse current even after prolonged hightemperature exposure (s275	°C for 24 h) in air.
