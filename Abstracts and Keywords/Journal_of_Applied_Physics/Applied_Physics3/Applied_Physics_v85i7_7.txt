Hybrid inorganic:organic composites of TiO2:APSS were fabricated by mixing the constituents in the gas phase using the technique of laser-assisted molecular beam deposition. Ultraviolet-visible and infrared spectra of the composite thin films indicate that the organic monomeric chromophore is physically embedded within the titanium dioxide matrix without any thermal degradation. Two-photon pumped up-converted fluorescence emission is observed in the films, such that irradiation of the film at 800 nm results in a highly visible green emission. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.
