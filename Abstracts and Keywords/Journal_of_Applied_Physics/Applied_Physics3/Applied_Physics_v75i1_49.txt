The piezoelectric properties of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric thin layers were investigated by interferometry as a function of frequency and dc electric bias. Materials included: a ferroelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) with a Zr/Ti ratio of 53/47; a relaxor ferroelectric Lamodified PZT with a Zr/Ti ratio of 70/30 and a La content of 7.8 at.	%; and antiferroelectric lead zirconate. The hysteretic behavior of the piezoelectric coefficient due to polarization reversal was also studied. The layers were prepared by a solgel method, and were found to have properties similar to bulk ceramics. Significant strain levels could be achieved in the materials due to the relatively high electric strengths supported in thinlayer form. Polarization was found to be completely switchable between forward and reverse directions; however, the strain levels generated by switching were found to be inequivalent. In addition, pronounced piezoelectric relaxations and strong piezoelectric losses were observed.
