Effects of an impurity sheet in the middle of the well on resonant tunneling are theoretically analyzed in doublebarrier structures. It was found that the energies of the evenresonance states shift toward higher levels and the states get broader as the height of the perturbation potential strength increases. There are no changes in the oddresonance states because of the nature of their wave functions. © 1995 American Institute of Physics.
