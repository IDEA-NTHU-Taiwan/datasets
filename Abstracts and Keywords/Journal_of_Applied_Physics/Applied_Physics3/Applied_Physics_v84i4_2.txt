The temperature dependence of the currentvoltage characteristics of NiGaN Schottky barriers have been measured and analyzed. It was found that the enhanced tunneling component in the transport current of metal-GaN Schottky barrier contacts is a likely explanation for the large scatter in the measured Richardson constant. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.
