In this article an electron energy loss spectroscopy investigation of CNx thin films is reported. The bonding, composition, and structure are discussed and a more thorough extended energy loss spectroscopy investigation is carried out to determine the interatomic distances. The extended energy loss fine structure analysis reveals a component with an unusually high frequency in the data corresponding to an interatomic distance of approximately 7.3 Å. This is suggested to originate from backscattering from distant curved atomic layers. © 1997 American Institute of Physics.
