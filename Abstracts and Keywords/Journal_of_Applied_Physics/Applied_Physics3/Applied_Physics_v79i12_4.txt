The binding energy of the ground state of a hydrogenic offcenter donor in a spherical quantum dot in a magnetic field is calculated by a variational method within the effectivemass approximation. The effects of location on a hydrogenic donor in a magnetic field on the binding energy of the ground state are studied. It is found that in the case of an oncenter donor, the magnetic field tends to enhance the strength of the Coulomb interaction and the binding energy of the ground state, and in the case of an offcenter donor, the effect of the magnetic field on the binding energy of the ground state is somewhat complicated. © 1996 American Institute of Physics.
