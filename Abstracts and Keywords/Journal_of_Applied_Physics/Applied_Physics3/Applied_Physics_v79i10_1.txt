Experimental data of mercury vacancy equilibria in Hg1xCdxTe for the compositions x=0.2 and x=0.3 are presented. In addition to common Halleffect measurements, the composition x=0.2 is also studied by the positron annihilation technique. The results obtained are in good agreement with data published in the early eighties. A systematic discussion of the change of vacancy equilibria as well as conduction type for the composition interval x=0.2 to x=0.4 is given. © 1996 American Institute of Physics.
