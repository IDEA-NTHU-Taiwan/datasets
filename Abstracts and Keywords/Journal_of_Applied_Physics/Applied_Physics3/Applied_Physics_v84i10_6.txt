In this paper, the Raman spectrum of Ti3SiC2 is reported and compared with that of TiC0.67. All the TiC0.67 first order Raman disorder-induced modes are active, but shifted, in Ti3SiC2. Two additional peaks at 150 and 372
cm1 are observed in Ti3SiC2. The former is ascribed to a shear mode between the Si and Ti planes; the origin of the latter is unknown. No second order Raman bands are detected. Micro-Raman spectroscopy also reveal the presence of H 50
Å graphite crystallites in samples hot pressed in graphite diesthese crystallites are not detected in samples processed by hot isostatic pressing in molten glass containers. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.
