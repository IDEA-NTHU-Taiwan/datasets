It was found that the spontaneous polarization Ps in some area of triglycine sulfate (DLalanine) crystal with periodic laminar ferroelectric domains cannot be reversed with an applied electric field. By using the nematic liquidcrystal method, the direct observation of the dynamics of the domain walls in the switching processes has been carried out. It is reasonable to assume that above experimental phenomena are due to the existence of a series of inclined domain walls in the specimen. The experimental methods and some observed preliminary results are reported. © 1996 American Institute of Physics.
