Resistivity, thermopower, and Halleffect measurements on large single crystals of the anatase form of TiO2 all indicate high mobility ntype carriers that are produced by thermal excitation from a density of <1018 cm3 putatively present shallow donor states. The decrease of the mobility with increasing temperature is consistent with the scattering of carriers by the optical phonons of TiO2.
