A ferromagnetic sphere is uniformly magnetized in a large field. As the field decreases, there is a critical field (the nucleation field) at which the magnetization becomes nonuniform. The initial deviation from uniform magnetization (the nucleation mode) is either coherent rotation or curling. By contrast, a ferromagnetic cube is never uniformly magnetized, and theorists have disagreed on whether nucleation theory for a sphere can be generalized to a cube. A three-dimensional numerical model of a cube is used to show there is a bifurcation at which a curl appears in the magnetization. This bifurcation is a generalized curling-mode nucleation. The nucleation field for a small cube fits the equation for a sphere of the same volume with a reduced demagnetizing factor. The nucleation mode is well approximated by the curling mode for the sphere. The magnetization changes continuously, so the nucleation field is not equal to the switching field or coercivity. When the cube size is twice the single-domain critical size, the nucleation field starts to increase faster than the inverse square of the size. This offers a possible resolution of Browns paradox. It has been suggested that nucleation in large particles may begin at the corners, but it is shown here that the greatest deviations are in the center of two opposing faces. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.
