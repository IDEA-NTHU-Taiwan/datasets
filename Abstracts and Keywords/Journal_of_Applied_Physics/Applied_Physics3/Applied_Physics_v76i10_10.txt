An inhomogeneous laminar conductor model developed earlier has been applied to glasses in the system Na2OGeO2. Detailed modulus spectra have been measured for glasses containing 1020 mol	% Na2O. The experimental data are in satisfactory agreement with the theoretical values as obtained by this model.
