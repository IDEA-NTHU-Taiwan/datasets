Calculations are carried out which show minima or quasiminima in the voltagecurrent characteristics of semiconductor diodes for values of the plasma frequency/scattering time product of the order of unity. In this regime the minima are evident only for nonOhmic injection conditions. The results are consistent with reported experiments.
