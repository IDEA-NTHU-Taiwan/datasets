A method previously developed for predicting the coupled magnetoelectric effect in a piezoelectricpiezomagnetic composite containing ellipsoidal inclusions is a general, explicit method and not as Huang and Kuo [J. Appl. Phys. 81, 1378 (1997)] reviewed. After correcting two obvious mistakes in Huang and Kuos numerical results for effective coupled magnetoelectric coefficients, their results appear to be the same as one type of previous results. © 1997 American Institute of Physics.
