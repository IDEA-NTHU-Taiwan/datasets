The complex dielectric constants of Zr0.98Hf0.02TiO4 ceramics are reported in the frequency range 1031010 Hz for the temperature range 830
°C } T } 860
°C, just above the commensurate-incommensurate phase transition temperature, Tc. The disappearance of x-ray satellite reflections at 825
°C was used to determine Tc experimentally. The dielectric measurements show that a relatively narrow distribution of relaxation times is present in the ceramics, which broadens as the temperature approaches Tc from above. By analyzing the temperature at which the dielectric constant is a maximum as a function of frequency using the Vogel-Fulcher relationship, an activation energy of 550±15 kb,where kb is the Boltzmann constant, and an effective freezing temperature, Tf, of 825
°C have been determined, confirming that, to within experimental error, Tf coincided with Tc. The experimental results for Zr0.98Hf0.02TiO4 are interpreted in terms of a possible dipole-glass-like phase that has been proposed for relaxor systems. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.
