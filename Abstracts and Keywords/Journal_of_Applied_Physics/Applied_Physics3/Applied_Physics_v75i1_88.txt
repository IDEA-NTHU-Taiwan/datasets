The influence of an external electric field on the fluorescence of the ferroelectric vinylidene fluoridetrifluoroethylene copolymer P(VDFTrFE) doped by rhodamine is revealed. The fluorescence also shows anomalies in the region of the ferroelectric phase transition in P(VDFTrFE). These phenomena are explained by the influence of polarization on the radiationless electron transitions in the dye molecules.
