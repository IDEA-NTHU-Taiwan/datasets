Analytical calculations of the polaroptical intrasubband scattering rates in a cylindrical quantum wire using modeling wave functions, which fit very closely to the exact wave functions, are presented. The actual scattering rates are shown to be almost twice as large as those of earlier calculations when the spatial dependency of the wave functions of the confined electrons was neglected.
