Threshold current densities and wavelengths of gain maximum and longitudinal modes have been determined as a function of temperature for various laser structures. The onset of intrapulse heating has been studied and interpreted. In Zn0.92Mg0.08S0.12Se0.88/ZnS0.06Se0.94 /Zn0.8Cd0.2Se lasers, thermal resistances have been measured, using substrateup and substratedown mounting. From these, continuouswave lasing regimes have been determined.
