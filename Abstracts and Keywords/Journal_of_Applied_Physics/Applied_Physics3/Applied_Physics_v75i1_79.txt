The adsorption of nalkanes on graphite has been studied by scanning tunneling microscopy. These molecules can form very well ordered layers on the graphite surface. The results suggest that a transition from an ordered to a disordered state of the molecules occurs as a function of temperature. A model for the structure of the adsorbed layer and a possible explanation for the temperature effects are given.
