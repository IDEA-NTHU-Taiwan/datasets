A method for analyzing strong cylindrical blasts in cases where the source mass is not negligible is presented. Analytic expressions for the shock position as a function of time and shock speed and pressure as functions of position are derived. An approximation to classical TaylorSedov theory is extended to the nearfield regime where the source mass is not negligible. Results from example calculations are compared to TaylorSedov theory as well as thermodynamic free expansion. © 1995 American Institute of Physics.
