The microstructure of YBa2Cu3O7´ thin films grown on vicinal SrTiO3(001) has been studied as a function of the vicinal angle by x-ray diffraction using the two-dimensional q-scan technique. Our results reveal a strong correlation between the miscut of a SrTiO3(001) substrate and the anisotropic defect structure of the film. Furthermore, we observed an anisotropy of the corresponding critical current density up to 4.6 depending on the angle of miscut. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.
