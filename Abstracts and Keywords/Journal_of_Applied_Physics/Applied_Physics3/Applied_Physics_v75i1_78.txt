Vapor phase epitaxial growth of InP with halide as the transport agent has been carried out in closed ampoules on earth and under microgravity. On earth, a large variation in the thickness of the InP grown layer has been observed with the change of the disposition of ampoules against a gravity field. A microgravity experiment has been conducted on board the Technologische Experimente Unter Schwerelosigkeit rocket for a period of approximately 6 min. The growth of the Sdoped InP layer was confirmed.
