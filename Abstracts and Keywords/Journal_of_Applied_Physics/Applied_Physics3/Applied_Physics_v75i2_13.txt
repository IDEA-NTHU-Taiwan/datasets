The effect of He ion irradiation on the hydrogen content and structure of aC:H films has been examined. Comparison of elastic recoil detection and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results have shown that significant hydrogen depletion occurs in conjunction with an equally significant change in the structure of the films. Examination of the films hydrogen profiles also indicates that the diffusion length of molecular hydrogen in these materials during bombardment may be between 160320 nm.
