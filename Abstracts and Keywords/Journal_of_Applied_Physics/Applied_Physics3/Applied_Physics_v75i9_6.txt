Emittance and energy measurements have been performed on a highbrightness electron beam (s1010 A/m2	rad2) with diameter in the range 13 mm and energy in the range 150170 keV. This electron beam is generated by the mating of a hollowcathode discharge device operating in the pseudospark regime to the output of a highpower pulse line accelerator. The measured effective emittance lies in the range between 30 and 90 mm	mrad and increases with axial distance. Electron energy measurements indicate that the highenergy electrons are generated during the first 2030 ns of the discharge. Both the emittance and energy experiments were performed at two different ambient argon gas pressures (92 and 152 mtorr). Beam expansion as a function of axial position has also been studied and a lower bound on the beam brightness has been obtained.
