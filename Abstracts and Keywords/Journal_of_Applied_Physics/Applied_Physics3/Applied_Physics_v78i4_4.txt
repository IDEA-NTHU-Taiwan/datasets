Acoustical methods are a very important tool for the characterization of porous materials. In some cases, the appearance of two different longitudinal modes was reported which provides important information of the material properties. It was shown recently that for porous fabrics in water the appearance of these two modes is closely related to the properties of the fluid inside the pores. Here, we present a work on the transmission of airborne ultrasound through airfilled fabrics. The article confirms previously published results about slow wave generation and shows the use of the slow wave for characterization of porous samples. © 1995 American Institute of Physics.
