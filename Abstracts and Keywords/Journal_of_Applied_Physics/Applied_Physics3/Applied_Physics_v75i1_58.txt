Siteselective photoluminescence spectroscopy of Ho3+ ions in singlecrystal KYF4, measured with a Fouriertransform spectrometer at 80 and 2 K sample temperatures, gives evidence for two dissimilar classes of crystalfield sites. Three similar sites contribute to each class giving a total of six sites in agreement with recent crystallographic results. Analysis of crystalfield splittings indicates that only one of the classes can contribute to Yb’Ho upconversion green lasing in (Yb,Ho):KYF4.
