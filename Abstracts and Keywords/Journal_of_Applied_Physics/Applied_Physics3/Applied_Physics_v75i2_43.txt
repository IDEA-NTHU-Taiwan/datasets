The structure and magnetic properties of nanocrystalline, twophase Sm2Fe17Nx+±Fe alloys prepared by mechanical alloying and heat treatment have been studied. Remanence enhancement and singlephase magnetic behavior were observed in isotropic powders crystallized at low temperatures (about 600	°C), while crystallization at high temperatures resulted in twophase demagnetization curves due to increase of the grain size of the soft phase. With increasing Sm concentration the coercivity increased and the remanent magnetization decreased.
