The magnetization distribution in the magnetoresistive (MR) film has been calculated by selfconsistently solving the threedimensional field of the MR head. The magnetization distribution was calculated based on the LandauLifshitzGilbert equation and the head field was obtained by the Maxwell equation. The longitudinal bias field for the domain control was generated by exchangecoupled antiferromagnetic or permanent magnetic films which were formed outside the sensing region of the MR film. The resistance change of the MR film was calculated from the magnetization distribution with shield films and without shield films. It was found that the resistance change with the antiferromagnetic film without the shields was about two times larger than that with the permanent magnetic film with the remanence Br of 0.7 T. The difference between them was reduced when the shields were formed because the stray field from the permanent magnetic film which is applied to the MR film was decreased by the shields. Further, the effect of the longitudinal bias field on the magnetization distribution was analyzed for the MR film without the shields. The influence of the antiferromagnetic film reached the region of 23 ¼m from the end of the film, while that of the permanent magnetic film reached more than 10 ¼m.
