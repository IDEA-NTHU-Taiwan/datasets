We have fabricated high-quality planar Nb/AlOx/Nb Josephson junctions on-chip adjacent to quantum dots in a near surface two-dimensional electron gas in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. When used as a voltage-tunable oscillator coupled capacitively to a quantum dot, the Josephson junction can produce a localized time-dependent potential of 200 ¼V across the dot at frequencies in excess of 300 GHz. The fabrication process involves five separate patterning and processing steps to define the multilayer integrated device. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.
