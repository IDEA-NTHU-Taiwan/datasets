The importance of long wavelength natural birefringence in AgGaS2 is pointed out for nonlinear laser devices. Such an important aspect is absent in the model presented by Choi et al. [J. Appl. Phys. 82, 3100 (1997)]. Their model represents birefringence dispersion but locates the isotropic point at 0.52 ¼m instead of where actually found at 0.497 ¼m. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.
