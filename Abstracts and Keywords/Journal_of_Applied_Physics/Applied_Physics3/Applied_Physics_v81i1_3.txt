The kinetics of dusty plasma in low pressure rf discharges is studied by solving self-consistently the time dependent electron Boltzmann and dust charging equations. The electron temperature, the excitation and ionization rate coefficients, and the dust particle charge are shown to be modulated in the periodic state. It is demonstrated that the presence of dust particles enhances the modulated amplitude, reduces the high energy content of the electron energy distribution, the corresponding effective electron temperature, and the electron excitation and ionization rate coefficients. © 1997 American Institute of Physics.
