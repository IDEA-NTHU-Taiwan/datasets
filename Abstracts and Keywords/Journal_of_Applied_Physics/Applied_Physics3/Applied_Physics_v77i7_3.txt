The propagation in sea water of a lowfrequency electromagnetic pulse generated by an electric dipole is investigated analytically. The dipole is excited by a rectangular current pulse with a finite, nonzero rise and decay time. In order to obtain an explicit formula for the field in the equatorial plane of the dipole source that is uniformly valid in distance and time, Fouriertransform methods are applied. Certain limiting forms of the current pulse are studied separately. Simple analytic expressions of the field are obtained, compared to previous results, and examined thoroughly. The effect of the finite rise and decay time is discussed. It is noted that the present analysis may be used for studying pulse propagation in any highly conducting medium besides sea water. © 1995 American Institute of Physics.
