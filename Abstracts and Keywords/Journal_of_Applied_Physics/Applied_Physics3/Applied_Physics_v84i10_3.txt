Low-energy electron attachment to BCl3 was measured using an electron swarm technique. The parent negative ion, BCl3, was observed within a narrow electron range close to thermal energy. Previous negative ion measurements in BCl3 discharges, which yielded seemingly inconsistent results, can be shown to be self-consistent based on the present observations. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.
