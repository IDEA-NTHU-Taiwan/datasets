We have synthesized a new type of high quality semiconductor doped glass (CdSSe embedded in a fluorine-phosphate matrix) using batch technology. The linear and nonlinear optical properties of this glass are investigated and compared with borosilicate glass doped with the same semiconductor. The optical susceptibility of glass is measured using degenerate four wave mixing technique. © 1997 American Institute of Physics.
