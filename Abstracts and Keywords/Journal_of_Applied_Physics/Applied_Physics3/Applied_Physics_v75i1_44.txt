Water vapor adsorption isotherms were determined by the gravimetric method for a YBa2Cu3O7´ powder at 298 K. Adsorption energy released per unit area, adsorption site area, adsorbate fractional coverage, minimum pore radius, surface charge, surface potential, and adsorption bond energy were calculated to characterize the surface of the powder. The adsorbed water vapor may form an oriented chemisorbed layer.
