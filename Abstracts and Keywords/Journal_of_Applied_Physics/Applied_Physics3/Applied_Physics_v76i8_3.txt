An experiment was performed in order to determine whether a firstorder or secondorder mechanism governs the reemission of deuterium molecules from graphite during D+ bombardment. The order of the release mechanism should be reflected in the dependence of the reemission on the incident flux density. No flux density dependence was observed, indicating a firstorder process, in agreement with a hydrogen transport model where the rate of molecule release is determined by a firstorder process involving H diffusion within graphite crystallites.
