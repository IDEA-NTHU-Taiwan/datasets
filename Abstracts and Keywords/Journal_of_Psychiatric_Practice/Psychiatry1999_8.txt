The authors review the current state of knowledge concerning interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for depression. They first review the theoretical and empirical sources and rationale for IPT and discuss the work of Meyer, Klerman, Sullivan, and Bowlby. The techniques involved in treating a patient with IPT are then reviewed, including the four main problem areas from which the focus of treatment is selected: grief, role dispute, role transition, and interpersonal deficits. The authors then describe the three phases of a typical 12-16 week course of IPT. A case vignette illustrating the implementation of IPT is provided. In the last part of the article, the data on the efficacy of IPT in the acute and maintenance treatment of major depression is reviewed. The authors also describe findings concerning a number of other possible applications of IPT.
