Community mental health centers (CMHCs) face many new challenges today. The authors review the marketplace trends that are leading to a restructuring of CMHCs, including the demand for full service, payer-driven systems, customer-sensitivity, outcome-oriented service delivery, cost effectiveness, capitated systems of payment, a trend towards less intensive levels of service, and a trend toward carve-in systems and joint ventures. The authors then describe how a number of CMHCs around the country are responding to this challenge in innovative ways. The article concludes with a list of recommendations that can help CMHCs adapt and succeed in the current rapidly changing health care climate.
