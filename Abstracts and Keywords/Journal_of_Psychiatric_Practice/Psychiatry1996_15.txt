Alcohol-related problems in older adults and the elderly are frequently unrecognized or inadequately treated. The authors review the prevalence of alcohol abuse and dependence in these groups and discuss the negative impact alcohol use problems can have on the physical and mental health of these individuals. They discuss reasons why alcohol problems are frequently underdiagnosed in older patients, particularly older women, and describe techniques for improving diagnostic accuracy. The authors then describe what they have found to be the most effective psychosocial and psychopharmacologic treatments for alcohol abuse and dependence in older adults and the elderly.
