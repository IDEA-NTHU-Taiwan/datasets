The authors review recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis and neurobiology of schizophrenia. The familial nature of the illness, the 'neurodevelopmental hypothesis,' and biochemical alterations, including serotonin/dopamine interactions, are discussed. The authors review epidemiologic, radiologic, and histopathologic evidence supporting the 'neurodevelopmental hypothesis' as a model for pathogenesis. Neurocognitive and physiologic abnormalities in schizophrenia are reviewed. Differential diagnosis, epidemiological aspects, comorbidities, and treatment strategies are presented. The authors discuss the heterogeneity in clinical presentations of the disorder and the utility and side effects of conventional antipsychotics versus the newer generation of 'atypical' antipsychotics (e.g. clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine). Adjunctive and psychosocial interventions are also reviewed.
