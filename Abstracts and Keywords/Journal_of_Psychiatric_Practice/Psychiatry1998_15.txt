An awareness of contemporary literary culture can benefit practitioners of psychiatry at all levels of training, from the psychiatric resident to the clinician in private practice. Such considerations can raise perspectives and ideas not frequently considered in many psychiatric arenas, such as the ways psychotropic medications are perceived in popular culture and the ways these perceptions can alter the doctor-patient dynamic. The authors examine the historical links between psychiatry and the humanities and then discuss ways in which these two disciplines can be successfully merged in contemporary psychiatric education.
