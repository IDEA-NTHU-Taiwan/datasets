Three types of early intervention for schizophrenia are reviewed: 1) intervention during the prodromal phase with the goal of preventing the onset of schizophrenia; 2) intervention during the early phases of a first episode of schizophrenia; and 3) intervention during the prodromal phase of relapse in patients who have had previous psychotic episodes. The author describes each type of intervention and reviews the outcomes associated with each based on studies in the treatment literature. The author concludes that, while early intervention strategies may not prevent schizophrenia from developing, they can be valuable in delaying the onset of the disorder, which may give the individual more time to complete academic training, obtain vocational skills, and develop social and coping skills. The author reports that early intervention during a first break episode can reduce the duration of symptoms. Since the evidence seems to indicate that the longer the duration of untreated psychosis, the less favorable the outcome, early intervention in first episode schizophrenia may improve long-term outcomes. Early intervention later in the course of the disorder can help reduce relapse and rehospitalization rates and lessen the pain and suffering associated with acute psychotic symptoms for both patients and families.
