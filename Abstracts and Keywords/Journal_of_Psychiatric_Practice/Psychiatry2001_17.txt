Relapse prevention is a primary goal in the treatment of schizophrenia. Relapse can cause significant personal distress, interfere with rehabilitation efforts, and result in psychiatric hospitalization. The emergence of psychotic symptoms and disruptive behaviors can also lead to arrest and incarceration, particularly among patients who are not engaged in treatment. This article focuses on the process of relapse in schizophrenia and theoretical foundations of relapse prevention. The Program for Relapse Prevention is presented, along with the results of a recently completed controlled prospective evaluation. Based upon this study and the current literature, the author presents a series of seven clinical strategies for optimal relapse prevention.
