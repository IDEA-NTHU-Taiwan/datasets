Private practicing social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists were surveyed to assess their perceptions of how their use of treatment modalities has changed since joining managed care panels. Social work respondents report that they perceive managed care organizations as certifying them to practice individual therapy more since joining managed care panels than they practiced individual therapy prior to joining managed care panels. However, they perceive managed care organizations as certifying them to practice group and family therapy less often since joining managed care panels. Psychologist respondents report that they perceive managed care organizations as certifying them less often for all treatment modalities except individual therapy. Likewise psychiatrist respondents report they perceive managed care organizations as certifying them less often for all treatment modalities except medication management. These results have potential implications for educators and practitioners interested in pursuing careers in solo or group practice.
