This case report describes the history and hospital course of an otherwise healthy 20-year-old male with bipolar I disorder who developed symptoms of severe lithium toxicity, culminating in a seizure, despite a level of lithium of only 0.8 mEq/L, within the usual therapeutic range. The discussion emphasizes that lithium toxicity is diagnosed by clinical symptoms and can occur even at usual therapeutic blood levels. (<em>Journal of Psychiatric Practice</em> 2009;15:60-63).
