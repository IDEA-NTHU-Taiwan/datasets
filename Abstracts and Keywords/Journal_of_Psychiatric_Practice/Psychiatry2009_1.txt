Objective: The authors' goal was to develop an integrated model for teaching psychotherapy competencies across schools of therapy. Method: The authors surveyed the comparative psychotherapy process literature to identify core features of psychotherapy shared across schools and differentiate those features from the defining features of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Results: The resulting Y Model for teaching psychotherapy competencies locates core processes of therapy that are shared across schools on the stem of the Y, differentiates psychodynamic therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy on the branches of the Y, and locates supportive therapy largely on the stem of the Y. Conclusions: The Y Model offers an efficient, integrated, evidence-based system for teaching psychotherapy competencies across schools in a conceptually clear way that is free of competition and bias between schools.
