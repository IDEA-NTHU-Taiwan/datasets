The author first defines what he means by "successful cerebral aging." He then discusses how major depression and dementia can interfere with this process and describes how what he terms "chronic stress dysphoria" can contribute to neuronal damage and mental impairment. The author then reviews a number of types of chronic stress, including health problems, loneliness, loss of autonomy, inactivity, and low self-esteem, and suggests possible solutions for minimizing their effect on successful aging.
