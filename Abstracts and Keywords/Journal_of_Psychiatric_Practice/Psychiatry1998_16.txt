Compulsive sexual behavior (CSB) is characterized by excessive or poorly controlled sexual thoughts, urges, or behaviors, and was first described over 100 years ago. Although there is little consensus about definition or classification, CSB is generally thought to involve both paraphilic (e.g., pedophilia, voyeurism) and nonparaphilic (e.g., compulsive masturbation) forms. CSB has been estimated to affect as much as 5% of the United States population; 80%-90% of those with CSB are male. Onset occurs in the late teens or early twenties, and the disorder is generally chronic or episodic. Psychiatric comorbidity is common, particularly substance use and mood, anxiety, and personality disorders. Developmental, behavioral, neurobiologic, and sociocultural mechanisms probably play a role in the etiology of CSB and its expression. Treatment has not been well delineated, but individual psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, and 12-step programs may be helpful. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors may help some patients regulate their sexual impulses, while anti-androgens may be helpful in sexually aggressive forms of CSB.
