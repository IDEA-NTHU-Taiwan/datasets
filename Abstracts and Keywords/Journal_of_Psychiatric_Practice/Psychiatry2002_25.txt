This study examines the complex and varied effects associated with having a brother or sister with a severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) on the lives of adult siblings without chronic disability. Through five focus group interviews, 19 participants were asked to describe the impact that having a brother or sister with mental illness had on their lives. Codes and categories derived from the text of the transcribed interviews were grouped into broad themes. The respondents described the manifestations and challenges of contending with the SPMI of an adult sibling. They focused on gaps in services and communication with mental health providers, particularly with regard to timing of interventions and identifying readiness for treatment, as well as their own mental health needs. The article concludes with a discussion of the increased need for exchange of information and clarity of communication among family members and providers, following best practice guidelines that are well documented but not well implemented.
