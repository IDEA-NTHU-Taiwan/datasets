Most people with severe and persistent psychiatric disorders have significant cognitive deficits. Both schizophrenia and affective disorders with psychosis are associated with problems in attention, memory, and executive functioning. These deficits are predictive of lower work status, impairments in social skills, and poorer response to psychosocial skills training. Cognitive impairment makes it difficult for individuals to benefit from focused skills interventions that they are offered. This article describes behavioral treatments available to address cognitive dysfunction in individuals with psychiatric disorders. The evidence for efficacy is reviewed and recommendations are made for ways to begin addressing cognitive impairment in mainstream psychiatric practice.
