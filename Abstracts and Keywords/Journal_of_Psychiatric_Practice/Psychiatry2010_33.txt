As the population of the United States becomes more ethnically diverse, clinicians are faced with treating patients from a variety of different cultures with various customs, beliefs, and practices. This case report describes the presentation of a 55-year-old Somali refugee suffering from depression and posttraumatic stress disorder, in the context of his culture. The discussion suggests ways in which clinicians may respond to and work with Somali patients, in order to promote their well-being in a culturally competent manner.
