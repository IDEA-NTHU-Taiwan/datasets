Multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic demyelinating disease, is one of the most common neurological disorders that affects young adults in this country. In this article, the author examines the cognitive impairment and emotional problems that can occur in association with MS. The areas of neuropsychological deficits associated with MS are reviewed, including effects on interhemispheric transfer, mood and affect, learning and memory, attention and executive abilities. Several methods for assessing cognitive deficits in MS are reviewed, including the use of cognitive screening tests specifically devised for this population, as well as the use of structural magnetic resonance imaging, functional neuroimaging, and other imaging techniques. The article concludes with a discussion of interventions to try to minimize the effects of MS on cognitive functioning and mood.
