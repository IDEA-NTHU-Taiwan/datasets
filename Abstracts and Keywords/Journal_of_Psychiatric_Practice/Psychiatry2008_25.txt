The similar efficacies of currently available antipsychotic medications (other than clozapine) make them appropriate for preference-sensitive care; therefore, prescribing these medications is amenable to shared decision-making. In this conceptual article, we describe the current state of antipsychotic prescribing based on a review of the literature from recent landmark studies and updated prescribing guidelines. Recent literature and guidelines on schizophrenia treatment in the United States do not reveal strong endorsement of the idea of shared decision-making. We suggest methods for incorporating shared decision-making into antipsychotic prescribing in the future, with an emphasis on the use of information technology.
