The authors review the literature on cognitive-behavioral approaches to the treatment of schizophrenia. They begin by providing a historical context to explain the recent resurgence of interest in this area. Next, they provide an overview of studies of cognitive-behavioral interventions that target poor insight, medication nonadherence, and refractory symptoms. Insight and nonadherence are emphasized because these are particularly common and problematic areas that present major stumbling blocks in the treatment of patients suffering from schizophrenia that are not yet sufficiently addressed by the interventions clinicians currently have in their treatment arsenal. The authors conclude that support exists for the efficacy of interventions derived from cognitive-behavioral approaches in improving some aspects of insight into illness, increasing adherence to medication, ameliorating the severity of symptoms, and mitigating other negative consequences of schizophrenia. Finally, the authors offer guidelines for future work in this area and emphasize the importance of identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from the use of cognitive-behavioral approaches.
