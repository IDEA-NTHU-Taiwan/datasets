Substance abuse is a significant problem in itself and can greatly complicate the symptomatology and treatment of comorbid psychiatric disorders. In the article, the authors review literature concerning the use of medication to prevent relapse to substance abuse or decrease substance use. Five different general strategies are employed for this purpose: 1) use of a drug with pharmacological properties similar to the substance of concern (i.e., agonist or substitution therapy); 2) use of a receptor antagonist to block or lessen the effects of the substance of concern; 3) use of a medication that produces a conditioned aversive reaction to the substance of concern; 4) use of a medication to reduce the reinforcing properties of the substance of concern; and 5) use of a substance to increase the metabolism or clearance of the substance of concern from the body. The authors review pharmacological treatments that have been studied for the treatment of dependence on the following types of substances: alcohol, sedative-hypnotics, opioids, stimulants, nicotine, hallucinogens, cannabis, inhalants, anabolic steroids, phencyclidine, and designer drugs. The article ends with a brief discussion of the importance of including psychosocial and behavioral interventions in any substance abuse treatment program.
