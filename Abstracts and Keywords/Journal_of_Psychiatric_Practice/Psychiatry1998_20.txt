Pathological gambling has become a significant public health problem that has only begun to receive research attention in recent years. The authors describe the diagnosis, clinical features, course, and epidemiology of the disorder. They also discuss the disorders that most often co-occur with pathological gambling: substance use disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and personality disorders, and outline the neurobiological and psychological theories of the etiology of pathological gambling. The second part of the article deals with the assessment and treatment of pathological gambling. The authors describe psychosocial interventions, including Gamblers Anonymous and cognitive-behavioral therapy. They then review pharmacological treatment strategies, including the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mood stabilizers, and opioid antagonists.
