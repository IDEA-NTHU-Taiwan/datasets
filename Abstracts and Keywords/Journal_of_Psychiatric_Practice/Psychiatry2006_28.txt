In medicine, and especially in medical school education, there is growing interest in and emphasis on professionalism, humanism, and clinical bioethics, as reflected in the Medical School Objectives Project of the American Association of Medical Colleges and the core competencies developed by the American Committee for Graduate Medical Education and the American Board of Medical Specialties. The authors first discuss the reasons for the increasing emphasis on this area. They then discuss specific areas related to professionalism, humanism, and clinical bioethics where psychiatrists are especially well fitted to play a role because of their training and experience. Finally, they suggest ways in which psychiatrists can play a more active role in this new direction in medical care and education.
