Until recently, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was a diagnosis reserved for children and adolescents as it was believed to dissipate before adulthood. New evidence, however, supports the persistence of ADHD beyond adolescence, and it is now recognized as a chronic neurobehavioral disorder in adults. Adults with ADHD have difficulties with school, work, family interactions, and social activities. Although treatments are available for adult ADHD, many patients never receive an accurate diagnosis that would afford them appropriate therapeutic intervention. If left untreated, adult ADHD can cause significant personal, social, and economic burdens that can have a negative impact on overall quality of life. This article discusses how ADHD presents in adults and the effects of the disorder on educational, occupational, interpersonal, and social functioning. Currently available treatments for ADHD in adults are also reviewed.
