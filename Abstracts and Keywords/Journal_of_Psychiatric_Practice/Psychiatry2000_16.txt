The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine if a low-cost alternative to assertive community treatment (ACT) programs could achieve results comparable to those previously reported by high-fidelity ACT programs with regard to state hospital utilization by patients with long-term, treatment-refractory serious mental illness and high rates of hospital recidivism. A sample of 30 patients was exposed to a low- cost alternative to ACT for a 12-month period. A quasi-experimental research design was used to compare state hospital utilization by the treatment group and a matched comparison group. The treatment group exhibited significantly less state hospital utilization than the comparison group and had an 88% reduction in state hospital utilization in comparison to its 10-year baseline. Low cost alternatives to ACT programs may be as effective as high-fidelity programs in reducing state hospital utilization and may be more easily adaptable to the current structure, operation, and financial constraints of community mental health centers.
