A dimensional perspective of personality disorders (PDs) provides the theoretical and empirical basis for symptom-oriented psychopharmacology. Pharmacologic approaches target the cognitive-perceptual, affective, impulsive-behavioral, and anxious-fearful symptom domains that comprise the state symptoms and trait vulnerabilities of patients with personality disorders. These symptom domains are believed to be mediated by the same neurotransmitter pathologies found in more severe manifestations in Axis I disorders and share many similarities in terms of drug responsiveness. Symptom-oriented pharmacotherapy is a useful and cost-effective approach. It does not cure personality disorders but may attenuate or even prevent stress-related decompensations (e.g., by targeting state symptoms and trait vulnerabilities that are manifest as state symptoms under stress). A related (and controversial) issue is whether the clinician should target the biological basis of temperament itself (i.e., "cosmetic psychopharmacology"). The clinician must also be careful not to "biologize" behaviors that may be more appropriately understood and treated by psychosocial methods. In this article, the author reviews empirical trials in the PD patient and applies the dimensional symptom-oriented perspective to the formulation of practice guidelines for indications, dose, and duration of treatment.
