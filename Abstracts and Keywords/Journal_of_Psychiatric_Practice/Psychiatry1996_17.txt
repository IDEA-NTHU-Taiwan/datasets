The authors review evidence suggesting that regular aerobic exercise-walking, jogging, swimming, or biking-reduces depression in healthy adults and in patients with major depression. Several potential mechanisms for the antidepressant effects of exercise are discussed. The authors then review the critical elements for writing an 'exercise prescription' and provide specific guidelines for recommending exercise training in clinical practice.
