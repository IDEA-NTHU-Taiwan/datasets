The author briefly reviews the history of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) since its invention in the 1930s and then summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of ECT. He discusses the use of ECT in treating unipolar and bipolar depression, psychotic disorders, catatonia, organic mental disorders, and Parkinson's disease. Contraindications to ECT treatment are also discussed. The author discusses ECT's mechanism of action and then reviews procedures for administering ECT (pre-ECT assessments, patient education and informed consent, the use of psychotropic medication and ECT, seizure monitoring, anesthesia, treatment frequency and duration, and considerations related to managed care). Technological innovations that have been found to minimize the cognitive dysfunction caused by ECT are then reviewed. The article concludes with a brief discussion of continuation and maintenance ECT, which the author will discuss in more detail in a second article to appear in a later issue of this journal.
