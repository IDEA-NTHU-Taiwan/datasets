To our knowledge new-onset psychotic symptoms have not been reported in connection with the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. We describe two cases of brief psychotic disorder in adults who experienced the terrorist attacks from afar through television coverage. The patients were brought in for assessment to a medical center in the northeastern United States approximately 2 weeks after the attacks on September 11. We discuss the role of television coverage of stressful events in the induction of psychotic symptoms.
