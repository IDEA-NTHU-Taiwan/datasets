Objective. This study examined whether measurable changes in symptoms relevant to borderline personality disorder (BPD) occur following short-term treatment across partial hospital and intensive outpatient levels of care. Preliminary data on symptom changes among patients with BPD during the first 3 months of treatment in a step-down treatment program are presented. Methods. Of the 42 patients who entered the BPD-specific treatment program during the 18-month study period, 36 consented to participate in the study. Patients began treatment in the partial hospitalization program (where the average length of stay is 8 weeks) and then transitioned into the intensive outpatient program. Patients completed questionnaire packets upon admission, and again at 1 month and 3 months into treatment. The questionnaires assessed BPD-relevant behaviors and symptoms, including: mood and emotion dysregulation, parasuicidality, symptom severity, and quality of life. Results. Results indicate significant and progressive improvements in mood and emotion dysregulation, parasuicidality, and symptom severity following 1 and 3 months of treatment. However, neither global functioning nor quality of life dramatically improved. Conclusions. The findings from this study highlight the amenability of BPD-relevant symptoms to short-term treatments and demonstrate the possibility of measuring change in these symptoms within the very early phases of treatment.
