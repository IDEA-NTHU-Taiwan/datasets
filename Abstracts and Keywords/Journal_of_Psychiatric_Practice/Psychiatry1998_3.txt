The author provides guidelines for the recognition and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that can be used by the office or clinic practitioner who is not a specialist in this area. He first provides a historical overview of the development of the PTSD diagnosis. The author then uses a number of case examples to illustrate situations in which the office practitioner should consider a possible diagnosis of PTSD. The main body of the article deals with general principles for the treatment of PTSD at different stages of the disorder. The author discusses the role of pharmacotherapy, supportive psychotherapy, and psychoeducation in the treatment of PTSD. He then describes specialized treatment protocols that have been developed to treat certain groups that are at high risk for PTSD (e.g., veterans, police, rape victims) and discusses when the general office practitioner may want to consider referring a patient to a specialized treatment setting. Finally, the author discusses the particular types of risk the treatment of PTSD poses for the therapist, including forensic and fiscal implications, transference and countertransference issues, and the difficulties of managing cases that are refractory to currently available treatments.
