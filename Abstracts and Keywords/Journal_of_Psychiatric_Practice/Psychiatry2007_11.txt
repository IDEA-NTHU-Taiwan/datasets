Background. The goal of this study was to characterize the burden of anxiety among residual depressive symptoms in naturalistic primary care settings. Methods. A post-hoc analysis of a database comprised of naturalistically treated depressed patients across Canada was done. This bilingual (English and French), multi-center, randomized validation study was conducted in 47 primary care settings in four provinces of Canada. Patients who met <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text-Revision</em> (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for a major depressive episode, in the context of a major depressive disorder (<em>N</em> = 454) were enrolled. Eligible patients received open-label, flexible-dose antidepressant treatment. The analysis reported here was limited to patients whose depression severity was evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) (<em>n</em> = 205). Patients completing 8 weeks of open-label antidepressant treatment (<em>n</em> = 157) were considered evaluable. As a proxy for anxiety symptoms, scores on 6 items from the HAMD-17 (psychological anxiety, somatic anxiety, gastrointestinal distress, fatigue, hypochondriasis, and insight into illness) were summed to arrive at a composite anxiety score, which was then used to calculate an anxiety ratio (with the composite anxiety score as the numerator and the total HAMD-17 score as the denominator). Results. The composite anxiety ratio at baseline did not correlate with the probability of remitting at endpoint (<em>p</em> = 0.534). After 8 weeks of antidepressant therapy, remitting patients evinced a statistically significant decrease in anxiety ratio (<em>p</em> = 0.041). Moreover, an inverse correlation was noted between severity of anxious symptoms at endpoint and probability of remission (<em>p</em> = 0.026). The burden of anxiety, presented as the anxiety ratio, was higher in non-remitting patients at endpoint (<em>p</em> = 0.828). Conclusion. Residual depressive symptoms represent ongoing illness activity in depression. Sharpening the focus of therapeutic interventions in the clinical environment calls for tracking and managing residual anxiety symptoms.
