The ethical principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, and respect for the dignity and autonomy of the patient provide the moral-ethical foundation for the doctor-patient relationship. However, inability to obtain informed consent in the absence of advance directives as well as conflicting family sentiments can give rise to ethical dilemmas. We present a case of a 59-year-old man who survived a near fatal suicide attempt by shooting himself in the face and whose family communicated their desire for the patient to have medical care withheld. The ethical issues that emerged from this suicide attempt, including the family's perspective on the patient's right to die, are discussed in the context of a consultation-liaison psychiatrist's recommendations to a multi-specialty treatment team.
