The author reviews the literature on controlled studies of combination therapy for depression published since 1987, referring the reader to an earlier review by Manning and Frances for a summary of studies published between 1961-1987. The study designs and results of seven studies or groups of related studies are described in detail. The author also provides a critique of the methodology used in each. Based on his literature review and clinical experience, the author reaches the following conclusions concerning using a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy to treat unipolar depression: an accurate diagnosis is essential in formulating a combined treatment plan; combination therapy may be especially useful in patients who have high levels of cognitive dysfunction, have more severe symptoms, or have failed to achieve full symptomatic remission with monotherapy; and combination therapy may help prevent relapse and recurrence.
