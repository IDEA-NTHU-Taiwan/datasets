Family psychoeducation is a potentially powerful but underutilized intervention for schizophrenia. The authors review current definitions of psychoeducation for schizophrenia and the theoretical models on which they are based. They describe the shift in the paradigm with which professionals approach their work with families of those with schizophrenia from one of pathology to competence. The authors review the literature on family psychoeducation and describe studies that show improved patient outcomes as a result of family interventions, as well as studies that have attempted to prioritize key elements in family psychoeducational programs. The authors conclude that a growing number of studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in relapse rates as a result of psychoeducational interventions, but that there is not yet enough evidence to determine which specific elements of psychoeducation contribute to these improved outcomes. The article closes with a discussion of the most appropriate methods for implementing and disseminating psychoeducational programs for patients with schizophrenia and their families. The authors conclude that psychoeducational interventions must be well documented so that they can be effectively evaluated and that studies of such interventions should examine broad outcome measures such as quality of life, satisfaction with services, improved functioning, continuity of care, long-term impact, and cost. The authors also conclude that psychoeducation needs to be more fully integrated into existing mental health programs in a way that will meet the needs of families and patients.
