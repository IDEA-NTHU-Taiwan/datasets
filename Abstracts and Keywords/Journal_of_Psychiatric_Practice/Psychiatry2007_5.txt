The rate of lifetime exposure to physical and/or sexual abuse among homeless women is very high, and the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse is greater in this population than in the general population. The relationship between abuse and mental illness in homeless women is incompletely understood. Using multivariable logistic regression, the present study examines this relationship in a retrospective study of women seeking treatment at a psychiatric clinic for the homeless in Jacksonville, Florida. The results of this study indicate a strong association between abuse history and anxiety disorders, especially posttraumatic stress disorder.
