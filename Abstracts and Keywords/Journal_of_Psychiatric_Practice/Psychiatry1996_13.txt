It can only benefit all clinicians to listen to the words of a master clinician. This is especially true as the time constraints imposed by managed care require us to make the most of every moment in establishing contact with our patients. Leston Havens has inspired generations of psychotherapists with his ability to listen deeply and creatively and find just the right thing to say. It is not easy to pass on this kind of magic. Most of us will not have the privilege of watching Dr. Havens work in person. But we are pleased to present this distillation of his thoughts on what he does so well.
