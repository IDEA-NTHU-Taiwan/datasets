The use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) by psychiatrists has declined over the past several decades with the expansion of psychiatrists' pharmacologic armamentarium. This trend has also been driven by concern about food and drug interactions and side effects, as well as waning physician experience with these medications. Many psychiatrists, in fact, never prescribe MAOIs. Recent research has liberalized the MAOI diet and identified symptom presentations more likely to respond to these medications. Thus, clinicians must continue to familiarize themselves with the properties of and indications for prescribing MAOIs. <em>(Journal of Psychiatric Practice</em> 2004;10:239-248)
