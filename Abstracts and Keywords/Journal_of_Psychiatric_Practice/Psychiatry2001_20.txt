Dysthymic disorder, a form of chronic depression, has been studied over the past two decades. A variety of forms of research, from epidemiological research to psychopharmacology and psychotherapy outcome studies, has provided data that may help clinicians who treat patients with dysthymic disorder. This article reviews clinically relevant research studies and applies their findings to the clinical setting. Epidemiological research and prospective follow-up studies can define the risks of untreated and under-treated chronic depression. Studies on the phenomenology of dysthymic disorder can help the clinician assess target symptoms. Psychopharmacology and psychotherapy research can help guide treatment choices. The emerging literature on combining medication and psychotherapy can clarify goals for different phases of treatment. Thus the clinician has a significantly greater chance of helping patients with dysthymic disorder now than only 20 years ago.
