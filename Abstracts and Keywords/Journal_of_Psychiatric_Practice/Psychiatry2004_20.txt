This article concerns patients who have an irrational conviction that they have AIDS, despite medical evidence to the contrary, and who, despite medical reassurance, go on to complete suicide or make serious suicide attempts. Patients with such irrational convictions often develop this symptom complex in the setting of extramarital affairs and subsequent feelings of guilt and shame. Two case reports are presented, one of completed suicide and one of serious attempted suicide. Both patients were on inpatient chemical dependency wards at the time of their suicidal acts. A comparison is made to syphilophobia. The literature on the irrational fear of AIDS and syphilophobia is reviewed. Although such cases are not common and suicidality among such patients is not common, it is helpful for clinicians to be aware of the potential risk for serious suicidal acts in patients who develop this irrational belief system.
