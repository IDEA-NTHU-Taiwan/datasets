The Texas Medication Algorithm Project (TMAP) is a collaborative initiative involving the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, Texas medical schools and universities, and patient advocacy organizations. Its goal is to develop and evaluate the clinical and economic impact of using medication treatment algorithms in the treatment of individuals in the public sector with schizophrenia and bipolar and major depressive disorders. In this article, the authors describe three key strategies used in Phases 2 and 3 of the TMAP that they believe were critical to the implementation of the project. Strategy 1 involved gaining acceptance and support for the project by involving important stakeholders. Strategy 2 involved providing clinicians and care recipients with the education and assistance that was needed to implement algorithm-based treatment. Strategy 3 involved providing administrative supports and making design changes in the system that were needed to implement the project.
