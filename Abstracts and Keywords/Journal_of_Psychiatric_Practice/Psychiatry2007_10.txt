In this article, the authors discuss when it makes sense to consider using more than one medication to treat a single condition. They give a brief history of the use of polypharmacy in psychiatry and discuss how new discoveries in psychotropic drug development are making polypharmacy an increasingly important topic today. The authors then present a list of 10 criteria to guide the rational use of psychotropic polypharmacy and explain each in detail with examples drawn from clinical practice.
