The authors discuss the importance of early intervention in schizophrenia for improving long-term outcomes. In order to intervene early in the illness, clinicians need to be able to detect signs of the illness at the earliest possible point in the course of the disorder, perhaps even before full-blown symptoms have developed. The most common types of prodromal symptoms and duration of the prodrome are described. The authors then discuss risk factors for the development of schizophrenia and how the various factors interact. They describe phenomenological (e.g., subjective experiences) as well as cognitive-behavioral (e.g., difficulties in attention, memory, language, interpersonal behavior) antecedents of schizophrenia. The final section of the paper discusses the benefits of early recognition and intervention as a result of being able to identify those at risk as early as possible.
