Recent technological advances in health care are increasing knowledge, helping prevent and treat disease, and widening the options patients and their families have to choose from. However, at the same time, these new technologies can create ethical dilemmas and psychological problems. The authors discuss two areas in which new rapid technological advances have been made: predictive testing and genetic screening and assisted reproduction treatment. The types of psychological and ethical issues that arise for patients, family members, and health professionals in these treatment settings are described. The article concludes with an overview of the role consultation-liaison psychiatry can play in these areas.
