Background. A high percentage of individuals with cocaine dependence have a comorbid psychiatric illness, which complicates treatment of the substance abuse. This report will describe clinical experience using risperidone in cocaine-dependent patients with psychiatric disorders. Method. Sixteen male patients with cocaine dependence and comorbid psychiatric disorder (DSM-III-R) diagnoses, who were admitted to a voluntary, post-detoxification, intermediate-care inpatient substance abuse program, were started on risperidone (mean starting dose 2.3 mg/day) in an open-label, naturalistic trial. Patients were assessed weekly using the Clinical Global Impressions scale to assess overall functioning, a Likert scale for craving, the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, interviews with substance abuse counselors and patients, and laboratory tests. All patients had at least one other substance use diagnosis besides cocaine dependence, and 13 patients were taking another psychiatric medication. Results. Of the 16 patients, 13 (81%) were rated improved or much improved on the CGI scale, and all patients reported mild or no craving at the last assessment (after a mean of 32.6 days of risperidone treatment). No patient developed extrapyramidal symptoms or hypomania. Compared to a 32% historical completion rate for patients receiving treatment as usual, fourteen (88%) of these patients completed the program, and 9 moved on to the next level of care. Conclusion. The results of this naturalistic trial suggest that risperidone is safe and well tolerated in patients with cocaine dependence and comorbid psychiatric illness. In the short term, risperidone may also be effective in reducing cocaine craving and use and may increase the likelihood of completing substance abuse treatment.
