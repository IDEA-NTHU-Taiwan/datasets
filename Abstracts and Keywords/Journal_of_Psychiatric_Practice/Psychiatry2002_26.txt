This study examined knowledge of New York's Assisted Outpatient Treatment law, enacted November 1999, among adult siblings of persons with mental illness. Mailed survey responses collected between April, 2000 and September, 2001 from 100 siblings residing in New York State were reviewed. Only 48% acknowledged familiarity with the law. Possessing higher education, reading about mental illness more often, planning to occupy future caregiving roles, maintaining membership in a support group, and reporting that their siblings experienced more difficulties with treatment compliance were associated with a familiarity with the law. Among those aware of the law, two thirds incorrectly believed eligibility for a court order was contingent on a history of violent behavior. Low rates of general awareness and knowledge of the law highlight the need for further community education.
