In contemporary psychiatric practice, collaborative treatment between a psychiatrist and psychotherapist is very common. Much attention has been devoted to the fiscal, ethical, and legal issues relevant to this treatment modality. However, such collaboration had been proposed long before the advent of managed care, which has accelerated the trend to separate the dynamic and the biologic. While fiscal considerations have been highlighted of late, the underlying tension between the dynamic and biologic remains and with it the complexity and potential pitfalls that directly and indirectly affect patient care. These issues are often neglected or kept in the realm of the unconscious. The key issues of transference, countertransference, and dynamic issues related to medication are discussed from the perspectives of the psychiatrist, the therapist, and the patient. In this article, the authors review the literature in order to revisit and reframe psychodynamic issues, as a timely reminder for clinicians to look at patients in different frameworks, and as a means of enhancing the effectiveness of collaborative treatment.
