Seizures can be a serious adverse effect of clozapine, often a last-resort antipsychotic with unique efficacy for some patients. Several anticonvulsants have been reported to be useful in preventing further clozapine-induced seizures and permitting continued treatment with this medication. The authors describe the first reported successful use of lamotrigine for this purpose. (<em>Journal of Psychiatric Practice</em> 2010;16:125128)
