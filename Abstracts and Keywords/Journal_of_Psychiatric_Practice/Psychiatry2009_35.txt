Background: Only 30%-40% of depressed patients remit after 8 weeks of treatment with an antidepressant. We hypothesized that beginning treatment with two antidepressants would improve remission rates. Method: Relatively treatment-naive depressed outpatients (with DSM-IV diagnoses of major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, or depression not otherwise specified) were initially treated with a combination of escitalopram (ESC) plus bupropion (BUP), using rapid dose escalation to ESC 40 mg/day plus BUP 400 to 450 mg/day by study day 15 in an open-label, 8-week study. Remission was defined as a score d7 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17) at the end of the study. Recruitment occurred between July, 2003, and June, 2006, and the final patient completed the protocol in July, 2006. Results: Fifty-five patients signed informed consent, 49 of whom received at least one dose of study medication. Of the 49 patients, 28 (57%) were women and 30 (61%) had a current diagnosis of major depressive disorder; the mean age was 38±12 years, and the mean pre-treatment HAM-D17 score was 16±4. Sixteen (33%) of the patients remitted by study week 2, and 31 (63%) by week 8. Nine patients (18%) dropped out prior to their week 8 visit, 5 of them because of side effects. Limitations: The lack of a comparison group and the use of non-blind raters are drawbacks of this study. Conclusions: This open-label study suggests that increased numbers of patients may benefit from dual therapy with ESC plus BUP and that the benefit may perhaps include an increased likelihood of early response.
