The authors describe the biobehavioral management of chronic pain. They first discuss how to conduct a thorough pain assessment that includes an evaluation of medical-psychiatric and cognitive-behavioral factors. They describe the most useful self-report measures as well as cognitive-behavioral techniques for assessing pain, such as diary records, behavioral observation, and the evaluation of pain coping strategies and negative pain-related cognitions. The second half of the article focuses on the biobehavioral treatment of chronic pain and includes a detailed review of both pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatment strategies.
