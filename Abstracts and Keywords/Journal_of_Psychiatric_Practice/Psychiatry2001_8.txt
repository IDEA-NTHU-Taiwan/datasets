The authors describe their approach to the patient presenting with a first episode of psychosis. This approach differs from the treatment of established/chronic patients and is critical in insuring proper assessment and initial treatment and may possibly influence the prognosis. Using prototypical cases, the authors give an overview of the first encounter, working with the family, differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.
