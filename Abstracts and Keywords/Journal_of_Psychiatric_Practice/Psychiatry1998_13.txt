This article reviews the assessment and treatment of binge eating disorder (BED). BED is a new eating disorder category for which research criteria are included in DSM-IV. BED is defined by recurrent episodes of binge eating without the presence of the extreme compensatory weight control practices that define bulimia nervosa. Individuals with BED are frequently obese and have high rates of medical and psychiatric morbidity. The accumulating literature regarding this new diagnosis is reviewed with a particular focus on assessment and treatment. Recommendations for multimodal assessment of BED and its associated features are offered. Preliminary data suggest that behavioral weight control treatment may be efficacious for both binge eating and weight loss and that cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal psychotherapies may be efficacious for binge eating. Reductions in binge eating and improvements in psychological functioning appear to be well maintained following behavioral weight control, cognitive behavioral, and interpersonal therapies. Preliminary data suggest that antidepressants may produce significant acute reductions in binge eating. Although little is known about maintenance, the few available data suggest that relapse is frequent and rapid following discontinuation of medication. Little is known about how best to sequence treatments for nonresponders. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.
