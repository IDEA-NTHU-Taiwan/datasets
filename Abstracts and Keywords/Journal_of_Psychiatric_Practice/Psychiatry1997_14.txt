Twenty years ago the Supreme Court of California handed down the second Tarasoff decision and drastically affected the practice of psychotherapy. Since that time, much has been written about that case and its implications for therapists. The present paper reviews the most important elements of the literature pertaining to Tarasoff and considers the court's decision in the two Tarasoff cases. Trends in the legal evolution and interpretation of the duty to protect third parties established by the Supreme Court of California are examined, and a potential expansion of Tarasoff in California is considered. Guidelines for therapists in practice are discussed so that the best interests of patients may be served and professionals may shield themselves from tort liability.
