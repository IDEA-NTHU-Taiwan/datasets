The goal of the STAndards for BipoLar Excellence (STABLE) project was to advance quality of care for bipolar disorder by promoting improved recognition and increased use of evidence-based practices. This article presents a brief overview of the project's objectives, the make-up of the STABLE National Coordinating Council, and the development and field testing of a series of evidence-based clinical performance measures. Findings from field testing of these measures are summarized and highlight the continuing gap between current care and evidence-based recommendations in many key clinical areas in psychiatric and primary care.
