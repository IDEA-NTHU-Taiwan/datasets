Depression is common among older adults. However, much of our clinical understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of depression is based on research with younger patients. Depression among geriatric patients may be phenomenologically different than in young adults. Depression with onset in late life is also more likely to be associated with neurological abnormalities than early onset depression. Thus, while there is overlap between the way depression is diagnosed and treated among geriatric patients and younger adults, there are also important differences that practitioners treating geriatric depressed patients must keep in mind. The authors present a general review of the diagnosis and treatment of depression in geriatric patients. Particular emphasis is given to the unique aspects of depression among older adults and to the specialized approach needed to treat this population.
