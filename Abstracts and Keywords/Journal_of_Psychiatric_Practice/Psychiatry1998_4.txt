In the first part of this two-part article, the authors describe the theoretical principles that underlie the use of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) in the treatment of patients with borderline personality I disorder (BPD). The treatment targets in DBT are derived from a biosocial theory of borderline personality which states that the primary problem in BPD is emotional dysregulation, defined as being more vulnerable to intense emotional reactions while having deficits in the ability to regulate emotion. The theory posits that the behaviors associated with BPD (e.g., lack of control of emotions, chaotic interpersonal relationships, poor sense of self, impulsive behavior) develop when a child with difficulty regulating emotion is placed in an invalidating environment. This transaction between an emotionally vulnerable individual and an invalidating environment gives rise to six behavioral patterns that are characteristic of BPD: emotional vulnerability versus self-invalidation, active-passivity versus apparent competence, and inhibited grieving versus unrelenting crises. The authors then explain how DBT structures the treatment of severely disordered patients with BPD. The article concludes with a discussion of three major sets of principles that guide DBT treatment interventions: behavioral principles, acceptance strategies, and dialectical philosophy. In Part II of this article, the authors will describe DBT strategies in depth and illustrate how these principles can be applied in clinical practice.
