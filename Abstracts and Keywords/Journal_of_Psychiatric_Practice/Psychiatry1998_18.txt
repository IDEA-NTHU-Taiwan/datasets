The authors discuss the major movement disorders that can be induced by psychotropic medications and summarize what is known to date about ethnic differences in susceptibility. They discuss acute dystonias, parkinsonism, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, acute akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, and postural tremor. Based on the evidence they present, the authors conclude that Asian patients receiving antipsychotic medications appear to be at increased risk of developing extrapyramidal symptoms other than tardive dyskinesia and should possibly receive lower dosages of antipsychotic medications as a consequence. The authors conclude that African American patients appear to be at increased risk of tardive dyskinesia and may require lower doses of antipsychotic medications than are usually prescribed because of significantly slower metabolism of many of these medications. African Americans may also be more sensitive to the adverse effects of lithium, suggesting that lower doses of lithium may be appropriate in this population. The authors conclude by stressing the need for research on the appropriate dosing and side effect profiles of the newer atypical antipsychotic medications in relation to ethnicity.
