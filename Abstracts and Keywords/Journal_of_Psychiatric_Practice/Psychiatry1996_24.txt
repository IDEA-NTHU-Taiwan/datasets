In the second of two articles on ECT (see "Electroconvulsive Therapy: An Overview" in our July 1996 issue), the author outlines the role of ECT in the continuation and maintenance treatment of depression and reviews the literature on the subject. Four cases are then presented that illustrate three indications for continuation and maintenance ECT: ECT-responsive, relatively uncomplicated acute depression; frequently relapsing depression unresponsive to antidepressant and mood stabilizing medication; and complex, relatively treatment refractory, apparently unremitting depression. In the more complicated, longer lasting depressions, boundaries among acute, continuation, and maintenance ECT may at times be obscure and a highly flexible, possibly very extended use of ECT may be necessary. The author suggests that noncompliance with continuation and maintenance ECT is an important and under-appreciated clinical problem. He also suggests that attention to the duration and periodicity of previous episodes of depression and to the time within an episode when acute and continuation treatment are initiated may provide some prospective guidelines for treatment.
