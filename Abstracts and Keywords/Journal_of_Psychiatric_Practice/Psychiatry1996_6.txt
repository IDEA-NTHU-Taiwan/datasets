The authors review the latest information on the evaluation and treatment of insomnia disorders. They describe the organization of sleep disorders in DSM-IV and present an algorithm for distinguishing patients with insomnia from those with other types of sleep-related symptoms. The questions to be considered in the initial evaluation of an insomnia complaint and the role of sleep diaries and polysomnography are reviewed. The authors explain the often confusing differential diagnosis of sleep disorders (e.g., when the insomnia complaints associated with a mood disorder would warrant an additional sleep disorder diagnosis). They then review the treatment of insomnia, including behavioral and psychotherapy treatments (sleep hygiene instruction, sleep restriction therapy, stimulus control therapy, cognitive therapy, and relaxation training), pharmacological treatments (including benzodiazepines and antidepressants), and other somatic treatments (e.g., bright light). The article ends with a discussion of which treatments are most appropriate for primary insomnia, insomnia related to another mental disorder, insomnia due to a general medical condition, and substance-induced insomnia.
