Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate (1) the frequency of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) in patients with schizophrenia, (2) the impact of OCS on clinical features of schizophrenia, and (3) the association between type of antipsychotic treatment and presence of OCS. Methods: OCS were evaluated using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) in 70 patients with schizophrenia. The patients were then divided into two subgroups: those with at least a moderate level of OCS and those with mild or absent OCS. The two subgroups were compared using scores on the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF). Results: Of the 70 patients with schizophrenia who were evaluated, 36 (51.4%) had at least moderate OCS (Y-BOCS score &gt;16). SAPS subscale scores for hallucinations and delusions and GAF scores were found to be significantly higher among patients with at least moderate OCS, compared with those with mild or absent OCS. A significant relationship between at least moderate OCS and treatment with conventional antipsychotics was also observed. Conclusions: The presence of OCS seems to have the potential to affect clinical outcomes in schizophrenia and treatment with conventional antipsychotics appears to be correlated with the presence of OCS.
