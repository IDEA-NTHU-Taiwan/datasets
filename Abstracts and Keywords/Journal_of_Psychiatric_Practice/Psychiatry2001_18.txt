The atypical or novel antipsychotics have advanced the treatment of schizophrenia, especially given their reduced extrapyramidal side effect liability. In this article, the authors examine a number of recently published or presented studies of the atypical antipsychotics, many of them post approval studies, that shed additional light on this class of medications. Clozapine stands alone as a medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but the other first-line atypical agents appear to reduce relapse rates during maintenance treatment and to have less of a long-term risk for tardive dyskinesia. However, additional research is needed to distinguish the atypical antipsychotics from each other and to better understand their non-neurological side effects.
