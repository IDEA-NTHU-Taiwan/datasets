The concepts of inner and outer interact with each other in myriad ways, both in the way we view mental life and in the practice of psychotherapy, within a therapeutic frame and in relation to the larger environment. This dichotomy pervades the relationship between the therapist and the patient, and the boundary between the therapy and the outside world. Through personal impressions, the author reflects on the dynamically shifting emotional and mental life of the therapist in his or her own life cycle and in today's world.
