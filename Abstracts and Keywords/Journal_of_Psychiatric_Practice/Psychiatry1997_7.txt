The authors describe an approach they call the "psychotherapy of prescribing" in which psychopharmacologists use psychotherapeutic techniques to help their patients achieve the maximum benefit from the medications they are prescribed. Three general types of interventions are described. The authors first review generic patient-focused supportive interventions and psychoeducation that can be used to help the patient understand the disorder and the medication being prescribed and to foster the building of an alliance between clinician and patient. Next, they describe psychotherapeutic techniques that have been proven effective for the treatment of specific mood and anxiety disorders (e.g., CBT for panic disorder, interpersonal therapy for depression) which clinicians can use as adjuncts to medication treatment. Finally, the authors describe psychotherapeutic interventions for the family that can help family members provide support that will help the patient adhere to the treatment regimen.
