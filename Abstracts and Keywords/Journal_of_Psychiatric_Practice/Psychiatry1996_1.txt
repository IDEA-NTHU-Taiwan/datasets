The author describes the increasingly important role of pharmacoeconomic analysis in the allocation of health care resources today and provides an overview of pharmacoeconomic principles and methods to help mental health professionals better interpret the results of these types of analyses. He begins with a discussion of the limitations of clinical drug development trials for determining actual treatment effectiveness and then describes the more inclusive approach employed in pharmacoeconomic analysis. The need to establish research guidelines and improved pharmacoeconomic methodology is then discussed, as well as the importance of quality of life and functional assessments in this type of analysis. The author presents a cost-effectiveness analysis of two hypothetical anti-depressants to illustrate how pharmacoeconomic analysis is done and some of the problems involved. He reviews some of the major pharmacoeconomic literature on antidepressants published in recent years. The need to extend economic analysis from pharmacological treatments to all clinical treatment modalities (e.g., psychotherapy) is briefly discussed and will dealt with in more detail in a later article. The article concludes with a call for mental health care providers to take a more active role in pharmacoeconomics research so that they can assure that access to the best treatment options is maintained.
