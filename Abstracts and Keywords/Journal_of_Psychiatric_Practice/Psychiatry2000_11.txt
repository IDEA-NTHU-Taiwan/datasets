The author followed 67 patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA) for a minimum of 5 years in a private practice setting. They were treated with a combination of pharmacotherapy (antidepressants or benzodiazepines) and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy. The author examines outcomes for three groups: A) 11 male patients, 10 of whom had comorbid conditions; B) 21 female patients with comorbid conditions; and C) 35 female patients without comorbid conditions. Symptom severity was assessed using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS). Patients in all groups showed marked improvement in all the domains measured by the PDSS, with the greatest improvement in PDSS scores occurring during the first year in all three groups. Patients in groups A and B tended to plateau after 5 years of treatment and show no additional improvement thereafter, whereas patients in group C (women with "pure PDA") continued to improve, although at a gradually slower rate. However, after an average of 11 years of treatment, the majority of patients remained symptomatic. The presence of comorbid alcohol abuse or depression was associated with poorer outcomes. The results in this effectiveness study are generally not as good as the outcomes of published PDA follow-up efficacy studies, but appear to be superior to outcomes in cohorts of chronically anxious patients treated decades ago.
