As a temporary psychiatrist in a Veterans Affairs mental health outpatient clinic, the author notes that he was given enough time (an hour for each first visit with a new-to-the-doctor patient) to review records, reflect, and identify new windows of opportunity for patients. He also found that, as a temporary psychiatrist, it was easier to "think outside the box" and identify issues that might previously have been missed. A series of ten cases is presented to illustrate these points.
