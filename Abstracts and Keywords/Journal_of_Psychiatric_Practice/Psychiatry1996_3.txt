In the second half of this two-part article, the authors review the current state of knowledge about the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) across the lifespan. They first discuss general principles of pharmacotherapy for ADHD and then review the use of the psychostimulants, as well as nonstimulant medications, for ADHD. A strong case is made for including psychosocial interventions in any treatment plan in order to address the complex set of treatment targets that characterize the typical patient with ADHD. The authors review the types of psychosocial interventions that have been found most effective in ADHD, focusing especially on parent training and pedagogical/behavioral school interventions. The article concludes with a discussion of how to combine psychophar-macological treatments and psychosocial interventions most effectively and how to treat ADHD patients whose conditions are complicated by comorbid disorders.
