The purpose of this article is to help mental health professionals learn to use the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) in clinical settings. The authors describe how the PANSS can be used to guide treatment planning, to optimize antipsychotic dosing, to facilitate communication among clinicians, to provide clinical data that will lead to better treatment, and to improve documentation in a managed care environment. They then outline how the PANSS can be used to rate symptom severity. They describe the training required to use the scale, how overall ratings and subscale ratings are derived, and the sources of information needed to complete the scale.
