This article presents a rational approach for evaluating research on the longitudinal relationship between childhood and adult psychopathology. While the article focuses on the specific issue of behavior problems in children, the approach used for this set of problems can also be applied to other syndromes. Prospective epidemiological studies examining the stability of disruptive behavior were identified through a Medline literature search. The degree of stability in pediatric behavior problems was compared across studies, and factors that moderated the course of behavior problems were identified. Pediatric aggression has been considered among the most stable psychiatric problems in children, which was confirmed by the studies reviewed. The importance of treating children is emphasized by the fact that most adults with a history of persistent behavior problems first developed signs of a disorder in childhood. Factors that predict outcomes for children with behavior problems were identified from epidemiological studies. These factors, in turn, suggest that specific brain regions may play a role in behavior disorders. It may be possible to assess functioning in these brain regions by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The data reviewed in this article provide a strong scientific rationale for providing psychiatric care to children with behavior problems. Future studies are needed to enhance our understanding of factors that can moderate the course of behavior problems in children.
