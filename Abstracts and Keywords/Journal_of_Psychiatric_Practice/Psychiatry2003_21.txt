While the past decade has witnessed a major proliferation of putative treatments for bipolar disorder, one medication-lithium-has proven its effectiveness through 50 years of clinical experience and scientific scrutiny. Unfortunately, because the generic compound, lithium, lacks the financial support of its newer, patented comparators, it is often neglected by clinicians who are exposed to continuing medical education (CME) and residency training programs that are heavily weighted towards the newer treatments. This article critically examines the medical literature on lithium's efficacy, anti-suicidal properties, and adverse effects. The authors present research-based recommendations for maximizing lithium's benefits and minimizing adverse effects associated with lithium in patients with bipolar disorder.
