Cannabis is one of the most widely used illegal drugs in the world and its use continues to increase among young people. Since cannabis intoxication can lead to impairment in motor, sensory, and cognitive functions as well as more serious psychological sequelae (e.g., extreme anxiety, panic attacks, dysphoria, depression, and even psychosis at high doses), it is important for clinicians to recognize and treat the possible psychiatric complications of cannabis use. The authors first review information on the prevalence of cannabis use to give an idea of the scope of the problem, and then discuss what is known about the mechanism of action of the drug. The specific types of psychiatric complications that may occur with cannabis use as well as the validity of the gateway theory (i.e., that cannabis use may increase the chances of abusing other, harder drugs) are then reviewed. The article concludes with a brief discussion of the treatment of cannabis abuse.
