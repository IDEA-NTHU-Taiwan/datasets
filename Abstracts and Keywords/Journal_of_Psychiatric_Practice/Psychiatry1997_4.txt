The author discusses what characteristics make the most effective psychotherapists. She begins by briefly reviewing the literature on the efficacy of psychotherapy and studies comparing different treatment modalities. Although psychotherapy has repeatedly been demonstrated to be effective, studies seeking to compare different treatment modalities have found little evidence that one type of therapy is better than another. For this reason, the author turns to a study of what techniques successful real-life therapists use. Based on interviews with 12 psychiatrists clearly recognized as superb clinicians, the author formulated a list of characteristics they all appear to share, regardless of their particular theoretical orientation. The author then describes and illustrates the common underlying orientation toward treatment she found among these therapists as well as four qualities they shared that appear extremely important in providing effective psychotherapy: flexibility, the ability to create a place of sanctuary, the ability to create a therapeutic alliance, and sensitivity to dynamic issues in patient and self.
