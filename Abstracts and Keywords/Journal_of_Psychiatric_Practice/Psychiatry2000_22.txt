Antipsychotics are commonly used in bipolar disorder, both for acute mania and in maintenance treatment. The authors review available clinical research concerning the use of both conventional and atypical antipsychotics in bipolar disorder and present recommendations for a number of key clinical situations based on this review. They also consider a number of important related questions, including whether there is evidence for an increased risk of tardive dyskinesia (TD) in patients with bipolar disorder, the potential role for antipsychotics in the treatment of bipolar depression, the role of antipsychotics in maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, the potential for antipsychotics to induce depression in bipolar illness, and whether antipsychotics can be considered mood stabilizers with a place as monotherapy for bipolar mania. They conclude that standard treatment for acute mania should begin with a mood stabilizer, with benzodiazepines used as an adjunct for mild agitation or insomnia and antipsychotics used as an adjunct for highly agitated, psychotic, or severely manic patients. They also conclude that atypical antipsychotics are preferable to conventional antispychotics because of their more favorable side effect profile and reduced risk of tardive dyskinesia. They review the evidence for using atypical antipsychotics as first-line monotherapy for mania and conclude that more evidence concerning the risk of TD and their efficacy as maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder is needed before a conclusion can be made. Should the eventual risk of TD associated with atypical antipsychotics be found to be minimal and their efficacy in maintenance treatment found to be high, they could eventually be considered first line monotherapy for bipolar disorder. They conclude that treatment with an antipsychotic during bipolar depression should be limited to those patients who have psychosis and that atypical antipsychotics are preferred over conventional antipsychotics in this situation, not only because of their reduced risk of side effects but also because theoretically they may have antidepressant efficacy due to their effects on the serotonin system. The clinical research findings summarized in the article are, for the most part, supported by a recently published guideline based on a consensus of clinical experts.
