The author reviews the major research from the last two decades on psychotherapy for personality disorders (PDs) and discusses implications for treatment planning. Research on psychotherapy of PDs is in a very early stage of development. Many studies are confounded by a lack of randomization and controls, associated inpatient treatment, the presence of comorbid Axis I disorders, the possibility that maturation or life events may have been responsible for at least some of the observed changes, and the use of medications along with psychotherapy. Nevertheless, findings from both controlled and uncontrolled studies of psychotherapy for PDs look promising. It appears that at least some of the major symptoms of avoidant PD can be effectively treated using social skills training and cognitive-behavioral techniques. Depressed patients with antisocial PD and opiate addiction may be far more treatable by psychotherapy than was previously thought. Patients with borderline PD who received weekly individual and group therapy following the dialectical behavior therapy model appeared to have reduced severity and frequency of parasuicidal behavior and a reduced need for hospitalization. Uncontrolled studies suggest that extended psychodynamic psychotherapy for a broad range of PDs may produce considerable improvement. Given the substantial medical morbidity, work disability, and need for hospitalization of patients with severe PDs, a strong case can be made for the cost effectiveness of psychotherapy for Pds.
