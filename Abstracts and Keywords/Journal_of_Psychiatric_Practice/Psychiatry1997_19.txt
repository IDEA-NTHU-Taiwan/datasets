In current clinical work, a comprehensive program for people with severe mental illness must include a component for AIDS prevention. Evidence for this position includes the elevated rates of injection drug use and high risk sexual behaviors as well as high HIV seroprevalence rates among psychiatric patients that confirm the spread of the epidemic in this population. Primary prevention allows providers to protect HIV-negative patients from infection while simultaneously reducing the incidence of other sexually transmitted diseases, unplanned or unwanted pregnancies, and experiences with coerced sex. Secondary prevention for HIV-positive patients delays adverse health outcomes, reduces the risk of further HIV transmission, including to unborn and newly born children, and improves skills for coping with HIV-related illness and adhering to medical regimens. In this article, we describe specific prevention techniques for this population, in particular cognitive-behavioral risk reduction groups and individual counseling in the context of HIV testing.
