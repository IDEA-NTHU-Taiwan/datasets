Women with breast cancer must contend not only with the impact of a malignancy and often mutilating treatment, but also a profound disruption in the fabric of their daily lives and those of their families. The author first explores some of the issues that women diagnosed with breast cancer may be dealing with, including feelings of loss and grief, the search for meaning in the experience, concerns about their body image and sexuality, the impact of the illness on their partners and children, and the possibility of recurrent or terminal illness. The author discusses ways in which the therapist can best approach these different areas of concern to help patients feel a sense of control and better cope with their cancer. The second half of the paper deals with other issues the therapist may face in treating a patient with breast cancer. The patients may have a co-occurring depressive or anxiety disorder that needs to be diagnosed and treated appropriately. Patients may occasionally make the therapist the focus of the anger they feel about their situation, which needs to be handled in therapy. Treating a patient with breast cancer may also arouse anxiety and concerns about mortality in the therapist. Finally, the therapist may need to help the patient negotiate treatment options with other health care providers.
