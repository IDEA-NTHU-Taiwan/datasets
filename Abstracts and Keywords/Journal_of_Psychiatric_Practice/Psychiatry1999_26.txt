Violence in patients with schizophrenia is a serious problem, affecting not only the patients but also their families, the providers of mental health services, and society in general. The risk for violent behavior in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia is elevated relative to patients diagnosed with other psychiatric illnesses as well as healthy individuals. The authors review the various factors that contribute to increased risk for violence in patients with schizophrenia. The increased likelihood of violence is related to the severity of psychosis and to the presence of specific psychotic symptoms. Comorbid substance abuse also contributes to violent behavior in patients with schizophrenia, as does treatment noncompliance. Emerging evidence indicates an association between comorbid psychopathy and violence in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The relevance of these factors to risk assessment and treatment options for violent patients with schizophrenia is discussed.
