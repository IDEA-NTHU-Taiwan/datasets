Whereas much progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia and depression in recent years, bipolar disorder continues to be frequently misunderstood, leading to its inconsistent diagnosis and treatment. In this article, we seek to identify the causes of this problem and suggest possible solutions, based on a critical review of studies concerning the nosology of bipolar disorder and the effects of antidepressant agents. Bipolar disorder appears to be underdiagnosed as well as frequently misdiagnosed as unipolar major depressive disorder. Underdiagnosis can stem from patients' impaired insight into mania and failure to involve family members in the diagnostic process and also from clinicians' inadequate understanding of manic symptoms. Underdiagnosis may also reflect disagreement about the breadth of the bipolar spectrum. We therefore propose a heuristic definition of bipolar spectrum disorder, a diagnosis that gives greater weight to family history and antidepressant-induced manic symptoms. This diagnosis would include all forms of bipolar illness that are not type I or II . The evidence also suggests that antidepressants are probably overused and mood stabilizers underused. We consequently recommend aggressive use of mood stabilizers and less emphasis on antidepressants In summary, the state of diagnosis and treatment in bipolar disorder is suboptimal. More diagnostic attention to the criteria for mania is necessary. In addition, the current pattern of antidepressant use in bipolar disorder does not appear to be evidence-based.
