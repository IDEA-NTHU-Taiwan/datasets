The author, coordinator of research, evaluation and quality assurance for U.S. Behavioral Health, explains quality assurance monitoring, how it differs from utilization review, and its role in managed mental health care. She then discusses the principles she applies in reviewing network providers' quality of care and describes how she uses a biopsy-chosocial perspective to evaluate treatment planning and outcomes. She explains the types of problems in documentation that cause her to question the quality of the care being provided and the steps she takes to obtain further information and improve quality. The author then discusses four case studies that illustrate the types of issues that arise in quality assurance monitoring. The article concludes with the author's suggestions for how providers can best document care, work with managed care reviewers, and constructively influence the managed care organizations with which they work.
