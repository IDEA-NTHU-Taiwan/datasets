Dr. Michels presented this talk as part of a seminar entitled "Are We Still Talking?" hosted by Dr. Jennifer Havens at the 1996 American Psychiatric Association meeting. In this talk, Dr. Michels first briefly outlines important trends in the development of psychodynamic psychotherapy over the last 100 years, as well as earlier challenges to this treatment approach. He then describes the latest challenge to psychodynamic psychotherapy-the changing face of the health care system and the move towards managed care. The talk concludes with Dr. Michel's view of the role psychodynamic psychotherapy will play in the future of psychiatry.
