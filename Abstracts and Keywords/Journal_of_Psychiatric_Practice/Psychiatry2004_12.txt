Much has been written about psychotherapy supervision for trainees in psychiatry. Psychiatrists are also encouraged to receive supervision when dealing with difficult patients or when involved in personal events that have the potential to have an impact on their psychotherapeutic work. Nevertheless, a literature search, conducted through Medline, revealed few publications dealing with supervision of psychiatrists who conduct psychotherapy in clinical settings after completion of training. This article discusses the issues involved in psychotherapy supervision for the supervisor, supervised psychiatrists, and their practice settings and patients. The author first discusses the benefits of psychotherapy supervision for psychiatrists in clinical practice, including helping psychiatrists maintain and improve psychotherapeutic skills, assistance in dealing with patients who have complex or especially challenging problems (e.g., personality disorders, intractable depression, difficulties with compliance, complex psychosocial problems), addressing ethical concerns, boundary issues, and transference and countertransference, and helping psychiatrists deal with personal issues that may cause difficulties in providing psychotherapy or issues that arise in working with a multidisciplinary team. The author then reviews key issues related to the supervisory process, including group versus individual supervision, the role of the supervisor, different supervisory styles, and factors that can contribute to feelings of shame or vulnerability in the supervisee. The author also discusses different supervisory styles, clarifies the distinction between therapy and supervision, and discusses issues that arise in the supervision of experienced psychodynamic therapists. Barriers that may keep psychiatrists from seeking psychotherapy supervision are reviewed. Finally the author discusses the supervision of those acting as supervisors for other clinicians.
