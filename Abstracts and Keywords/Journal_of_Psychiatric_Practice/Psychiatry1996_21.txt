The authors review the current literature on suicide assessment and describe the role of risk factors, psychometric asssays, and biologic markers in assessing suicide risk. They stress that it is not possible to predict suicide with any accuracy, but that it is possible and necessary to perform a thorough assessment of the relative risk. The authors then discuss how to manage the suicidal patient, including choice of the most appropriate treatment setting and type of therapeutic intervention for the individual patient. How to cope with attempted and completed suicide is covered next, including personal impact on the clinician, how to deal with family members, and how to deal with survivors of a suicide attempt. The article concludes with a review of medico-legal issues related to suicide.
