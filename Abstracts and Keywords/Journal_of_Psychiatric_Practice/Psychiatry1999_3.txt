The authors describe and compare the three major guidelines on schizophrenia that have been published in the United States: The American Psychiatric Association's Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients with Schizophrenia, the Expert Consensus Guidelines Series: Treatment of Schizophrenia, and the Schizophrenia Patient Outcome Research Team (PORT) Treatment Recommendations. Two of these guidelines, the APA Guideline and the PORT Recommendations, were developed based on a review of the research and outcome literature. The Expert Consensus Guidelines were develop based on statistical analyses of the results of a survey of experts in the field. The strengths and weaknesses of each of the three guidelines are discussed and suggestions are given concerning the most appropriate ways in which each of these guidelines can be used.
