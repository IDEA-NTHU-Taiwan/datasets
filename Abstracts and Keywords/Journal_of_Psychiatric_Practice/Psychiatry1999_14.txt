The authors describe the development and potential utility of treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder. The use of guidelines and algorithms may be especially helpful in the treatment of bipolar disorder given the limited availability of research data on treatment options beyond monotherapy, particularly concerning medication combinations and newer medications. The following guidelines for bipolar disorder are described: the International Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project, the American Psychiatric Association guidelines, the Expert Consensus Guidelines, the Texas Medication Algorithm Project, the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments, the European Algorithm Project, and the Department of Veterans Affairs guidelines. The authors then summarize the recommendations from each of these guidelines for the management of euphoric or classic manic episodes, depressive episodes, mixed episodes, and rapid cycling, and for continuation and maintenance treatment.
