Every psychiatrist, psychologist, and psychotherapist gets calls from attorneys from time to time, often with a request involving a patient. Patients sometimes ask their clinicians to become involved in their legal matters. Such calls and requests may sound straightforward, but they are often misleading, incomplete, or misunderstood. One should avoid being reflexively helpful when a lawyer calls or a patient makes such a special request. There may be no obligation to respond, or to respond immediately, although subpoenas must not be ignored; promptly contacting an appropriate supervisor, facility risk manager, malpractice insurance carrier, or one's own attorney is often the best course of action. Office staff such as secretaries and receptionists should also be trained and cautioned regarding the principles discussed here. (<em>Journal of Psychiatric Practice</em> 2010;16:253257).
