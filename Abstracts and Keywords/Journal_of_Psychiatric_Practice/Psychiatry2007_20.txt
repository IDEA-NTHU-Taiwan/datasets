Objective. Novel approaches to the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN) are needed. This preliminary study examined the utility and safety of an exposure therapy intervention and D-cycloserine (DCS) in a population of patients with AN. Method. Eleven participants completed a series of 6 laboratory meals, including pre- and post-exposure test meals and four exposure sessions. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either DCS or placebo in double-blind fashion before each of the 4 exposure sessions. These results were compared to data from a previously studied group of patients who received treatment as usual. Results. Total caloric intake increased significantly from the baseline meal session to the post-test meal session in the patients who received the exposure therapy intervention. Caloric intake did not increase significantly in the comparison group. Conclusion. These data suggest that an exposure therapy intervention specifically focused on meal consumption may be helpful in increasing intake of a test meal.
