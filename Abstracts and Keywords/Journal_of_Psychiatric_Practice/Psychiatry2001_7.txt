Alcohol and drug abuse occur frequently in individuals with bipolar disorder, but clinicians may often feel ill-prepared to identify such multi-diagnosis syndromes, to contextualize drug abuse alongside affective symptoms, and to formulate appropriate treatment strategies. Plausible explanations for high comorbidity rates between bipolar illness and substance use disorders are complex and likely embrace numerous factors that extend beyond simple, older theories about drug use as sheer self-medication. Evidence from epidemiologic, family-genetic, pharmacologic, psychosocial, and clinical psychopathology studies suggest that a majority of bipolar patients are at risk for developing lifetime drug or alcohol-related problems, which may in turn contribute to more varied and complex clinical presentations, accelerated relapses, worsening of depressive features, poorer lithium response, functional disability, and elevated suicide risk. In this article, the author reviews essential concepts about the phenomenology and treatment outcome of bipolar illness with substance use comorbidities and offers a systematic approach to the diagnosis and management of patients with such dual diagnoses.
