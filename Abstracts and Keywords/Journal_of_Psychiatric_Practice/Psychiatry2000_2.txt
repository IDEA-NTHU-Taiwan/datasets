This article reviews the use of self-help and guided self-help treatments for bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED). Available data suggest that self-help and guided self-help treatments based on empirically-supported cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) have efficacy for binge eating problems. Emerging findings from initial studies suggest that the magnitude of the differences in outcomes between certain guided-self-help CBT programs and therapist-led CBT may not be substantial, although further research is clearly indicated. Initial data suggest that self-help and guided self-help CBT programs may not only demonstrate "efficacy" but also "effectiveness"-i.e., utility in "real-world" primary care or community settings. Implications for clinical practice and for future research are discussed.
