Research meta-analyses have found that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is beneficial for persistent symptoms of schizophrenia. This review describes and updates the evidence base for this statement. A review of the existing literature (Medline, PsychInfo, and Embase) was carried out according to the guidelines for systematic reviews. Based on the findings of this review, the updated conclusion is that CBT has emerged as an effective adjuvant to antipsychotic medication in the treatment of persistent symptoms of schizophrenia. Studies of the use of CBT in the prodromal phase of psychosis and in combination with family therapy are currently underway.
