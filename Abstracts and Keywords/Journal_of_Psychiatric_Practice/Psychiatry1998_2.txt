The author briefly reviews the literature on the risk factors for violence in patients with mental disorders. He then presents a model for evaluating the risk of violence in clinical settings. In this model, the clinician gathers information from the patient and other sources in order to assesses the degree of formulation of any plan, the patient's intent to harm, and the availability of victims and weapons. The clinician then evaluates the patient's history for evidence of past violence or other impulsive behavior and does a diagnostic assessment, looking in particular for evidence of psychosis, delusional disorder, mania, personality disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, alcohol or substance abuse, or organicity. A complete violence risk assessment should include consideration of the patient's sociocultural background and past compliance with treatment. The author also discusses how therapists should respond to threats of violence.
