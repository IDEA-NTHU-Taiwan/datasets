Depression occurs in children and adolescents, although it may appear differently in younger patients. Research suggests juvenile depression may respond to psychotherapy and to pharmacologic agents, and that antidepressants remain a valuable treatment for juveniles with depression. Diagnostic considerations in juveniles with mood symptoms are discussed. A brief overview is provided of the evidence supporting psychotherapy for juveniles with depression. Controlled antidepressant trials in juveniles with depression provide some support for the use of some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and little support for atypical antidepressants, tricyclic antidepressants, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Evidence from suicide rates over time, autopsy findings among juvenile suicides, and impacts of antidepressant prescribing trends are related to the current controversy over suicidality and antidepressant use in juvenile patients. Based on this evidence, practical guidelines for treatment of juvenile depression are provided.
