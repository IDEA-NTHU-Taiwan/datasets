Studies have found that a large percentage of depressed patients may have limited response and remission rates when treated with traditional antidepressants. Options for augmenting antidepressant treatment include buspirone, lithium, and triiodothyronine. There are also increasing data concerning the use of atypical antipsychotics as augmenting agents in the treatment of unipolar, nonpsychotic, treatment-resistant depression. Aripiprazole has recently received an indication from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adjunctive treatment in unipolar, nonpsychotic depression, the first indication of its kind, after two double-blind trials; doses were slightly lower than those recommended for monotherapy in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Olanzapine and risperidone have several controlled clinical trials indicating the efficacy of both of these agents, generally at low doses. One trial of quetiapine suggested that it may not be effective in the treatment of unipolar, nonpsychotic depression. One open-label trial of ziprasidone indicated some efficacy. According to these results, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and risperidone are reasonable choices as augmentation agents, with only aripiprazole currently having an FDA indication for this use. Given the preliminary results, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with quetiapine and ziprasidone are needed, as well as studies comparing atypical antipsychotic agents with traditional augmentation agents in the treatment of depression.
