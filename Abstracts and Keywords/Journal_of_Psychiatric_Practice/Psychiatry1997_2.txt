The authors present two conceptual constructs that can help clinicians achieve more effective psychoeducation with those they treat: host factors and personal cost-benefit analysis. The authors define host factors as characteristics of the individual that affect disease outcome and treatment behavior and can be measured separately from the psychiatric disorder itself. The most important host factors are comorbid illnesses, including medical and psychiatric illnesses, and illness management skills. The authors describe how these host factors can affect functional outcome and then focus especially on illness management skills. They describe how illness management skills affect treatment behavior and outcomes and give some examples of how clinicians can evaluate their patients' specific skills, The authors then present a model of how patients use a type of cost-benefit analysis in making decisions concerning their treatment and discuss how clinicians can use this model in working with patients to achieve the best outcomes. The article concludes with a case vignette demonstrating how these conceptual constructs can be used in actual clinical practice to improve patient outcomes.
