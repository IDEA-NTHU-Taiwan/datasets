Objective: To examine the exercise patterns of patients in a partial hospital (PH) program and to determine whether these patterns are associated with mood symptoms and body mass index (BMI). <em>Methods.</em> Eighty-six participants completed self-report questionnaires upon entry to the PH program. We conducted regression analyses to determine the association of exercise, mood, and BMI. <em>Results.</em> We found that the participants' exercise history did not predict automatic thoughts or depressive symptoms. Current exercise did predict fewer depressive symptoms and lower BMI, but not automatic thoughts. A majority of participants were overweight and reported not exercising, despite acknowledging that they were not physically fit and that exercise is beneficial. <em>Conclusion.</em> We recommend that exercise programs be piloted in PH settings to improve patients' mental as well as physical health. Future research should further examine obstacles to exercising in clinical populations.
