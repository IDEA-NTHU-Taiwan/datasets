Over the past decade, both clinical and research interest in the early stages of psychotic disorders has grown. This has been associated with research suggesting that early intervention in these disorders may limit their impact on the life of the affected individual and his or her family. It has also been recognized that the biological and psychological changes underpinning the development of psychotic disorders may already be active in the prepsychotic or prodromal phase. It has been suggested that efforts to prevent psychotic disorders should be focused on this phase of emerging illness. In this article, the authors review work conducted at the PACE Clinic in Melbourne, Australia since 1994. This clinical research program was established to develop strategies for identifying young people at high risk for developing a psychotic disorder within a short period. The program has also investigated biological and psychological processes thought to underlie the development of psychosis and evaluated potential preventive interventions.
