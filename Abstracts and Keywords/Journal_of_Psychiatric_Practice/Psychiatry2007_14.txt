Open-ended psychotherapies have a limited evidence base for the treatment of personality disorders. In patients with personality disorders, in whom pathology tends to remit with time, intermittent rather than continuous therapy could be an option. Patients might be treated more briefly and then either allowed or encouraged to take breaks, while being allowed to return as new issues arise. While there are few empirical data on intermittent therapy, it may be common in clinical practice. This approach is illustrated by two cases of patients with personality disorders seen at multiple points in their lives.
