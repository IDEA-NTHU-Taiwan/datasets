The authors review the assessment of comorbid mental and substance-use disorders and provide practical guidelines to inform the clinician's diagnostic decisions. They describe how to differentiate between intoxication and withdrawal syndromes and substance-induced and primary disorders as defined in DSM-IV and present different viewpoints about how comorbid, substance-induced, primary, and secondary disorders can be defined. They discuss the types of psychiatric symptoms that may be associated with different substances (both substances of abuse and prescribed medications), focusing on mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders. How to assess personality disorders in the context of substance use is also reviewed. Finally, the authors provide examples of questions the clinician can use during the patient evaluation to facilitate diagnostic decision making.
