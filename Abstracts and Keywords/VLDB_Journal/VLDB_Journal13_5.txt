In-network aggregation has been proposed as one method for reducing energy consumption in sensor networks. In this paper, we explore two ideas related to further reducing energy consumption in the context of in-network aggregation. The first is by &#60;i>influencing the construction of the routing trees for sensor networks&#60;/i> with the goal of reducing the size of transmitted data. To this end, we propose a &#60;i>group-aware network configuration&#60;/i> method that &#x201c;clusters&#x201d; along the same path sensor nodes that belong to the same group. The second idea involves imposing a &#60;i>hierarchy of output filters&#60;/i> on the sensor network with the goal of both reducing the size of transmitted data and minimizing the number of transmitted messages. More specifically, we propose a framework to use &#60;i>temporal coherency tolerances&#60;/i> in conjunction with in-network aggregation to save energy at the sensor nodes while maintaining specified quality of data. These tolerances are based on user preferences or can be dictated by the network in cases where the network cannot support the current tolerance level. Our framework, called TiNA, works on top of existing in-network aggregation schemes. We evaluate experimentally our proposed schemes in the context of existing in-network aggregation schemes. We present experimental results measuring energy consumption, response time, and quality of data for Group-By queries. Overall, our schemes provide significant energy savings with respect to communication and a negligible drop in quality of data.
