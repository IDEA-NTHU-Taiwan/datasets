The optimized distance-based access methods currently available for multidimensional indexing in multimedia databases have been developed based on two major assumptions: a suitable distance function is known a priori and the dimensionality of the image features is low. It is not trivial to define a distance function that best mimics human visual perception regarding image similarity measurements. Reducing high-dimensional features in images using the popular principle component analysis (PCA) might not always be possible due to the non-linear correlations that may be present in the feature vectors. We propose in this paper a fast and robust hybrid method for non-linear dimensions reduction of composite image features for indexing in large image database. This method incorporates both the PCA and non-linear neural network techniques to reduce the dimensions of feature vectors so that an optimized access method can be applied. To incorporate human visual perception into our system, we also conducted experiments that involved a number of subjects classifying images into different classes for neural network training. We demonstrate that not only can our neural network system reduce the dimensions of the feature vectors, but that the reduced dimensional feature vectors can also be mapped to an optimized access method for fast and accurate indexing.
