In this paper we address the problem of modeling and implementing temporal data in XML. We propose a data model for tracking historical information in an XML document and for recovering the state of the document as of any given time. We study the temporal constraints imposed by the data model, and present algorithms for validating a temporal XML document against these constraints, along with methods for fixing inconsistent documents. In addition, we discuss different ways of mapping the abstract representation into a temporal XML document, and introduce TXPath, a temporal XML query language that extends XPath 2.0. In the second part of the paper, we present our approach for summarizing and indexing temporal XML documents. In particular we show that by indexing continuous paths, i.e., paths that are valid continuously during a certain interval in a temporal XML graph, we can dramatically increase query performance. To achieve this, we introduce a new class of summaries, denoted TSummary, that adds the time dimension to the well-known path summarization schemes. Within this framework, we present two new summaries: LCP and Interval summaries. The indexing scheme, denoted TempIndex, integrates these summaries with additional data structures. We give a query processing strategy based on TempIndex and a type of ancestor-descendant encoding, denoted temporal interval encoding. We present a persistent implementation of TempIndex, and a comparison against a system based on a non-temporal path index, and one based on DOM. Finally, we sketch a language for updates, and show that the cost of updating the index is compatible with real-world requirements.
