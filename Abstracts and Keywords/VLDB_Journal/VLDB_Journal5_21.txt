This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of a parallel object database server. While a number of research groups and companies now provide object database servers designed to run on uniprocessors, there has been surprisingly little work on the exploitation of parallelism to provide scalable performance in Object Database Management Systems (ODBMS). The work described in this paper takes as its starting-point the Object Database Management Group (ODMG) standard for object databases, thereby allowing the project to focus on research into parallelism, rather than on the ODBMS interfaces. The system is designed to run on a distributed memory parallel machine, and the paper describes the key issues and design decisions including: parallel query optimisation and execution, flow control, support for user-defined operations in queries, object distribution, cache management and navigational client access. The work shows that the significant differences between the object and relational database paradigms lead to significant differences in the designs of parallel servers to support these two paradigms. The paper presents an extensive performance analysis of the prototype systems which shows that good performance can be achieved on a cluster of linux PCs.
