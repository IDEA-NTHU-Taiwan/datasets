Traditional database query languages are based on set theory and crisp first order logic. However, many applications require retrieval-like queries which return result objects associated with a degree of being relevant to the query. Historically, retrieval systems estimate relevance by exploiting hidden object semantics whereas query processing in database systems relies on matching select-conditions with attribute values. Thus, different mechanisms were developed for database and information retrieval systems. In consequence, there is a lack of support for queries involving both retrieval and database search terms. In this work, we introduce the quantum query language (QQL). Its underlying unifying theory is based on the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics and quantum logic. Van Rijsbergen already discussed the strong relation between the formalism of quantum mechanics and information retrieval. In this work, we interrelate concepts from database query processing to concepts from quantum mechanics and logic. As result, we obtain a common theory which allows us to incorporate seamlessly retrieval search into traditional database query processing.
