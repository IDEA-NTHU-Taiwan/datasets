We describe a novel approach for clustering collections of sets, and its application to the analysis and mining of categorical data. By &ldquo;categorical data,&rdquo; we mean tables with fields that cannot be naturally ordered by a metric &ndash; e.g., the names of producers of automobiles, or the names of products offered by a manufacturer. Our approach is based on an iterative method for assigning and propagating weights on the categorical values in a table; this facilitates a type of similarity measure arising from the co-occurrence of values in the dataset. Our techniques can be studied analytically in terms of certain types of non-linear dynamical systems.
