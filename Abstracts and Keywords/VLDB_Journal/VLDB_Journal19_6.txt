Imagine a system that gives you satisfying recommendations when you want to rent a movie with friends or find a restaurant to celebrate a colleagues farewell: at the core of such a system is what we call group recommendation. While computing individual recommendations have received lots of attention (e.g., Netflix prize), group recommendation has been confined to studying users satisfaction with different aggregation strategies. In this paper (Some results are published in an earlier conference paper (Amer-Yahia et al. in VLDB, 2009). See Sect. Paper contributions and outline for details.), we describe the challenges and desiderata of group recommendation and formalize different group consensus semantics that account for both an items predicted ratings to the group members and the disagreements among them. We focus on the design and implementation of efficient group recommendation algorithms that intelligently prune and merge per-user predicted rating lists and pairwise disagreement lists of items. We further explore the impact of space constraints on maintaining per-user and pairwise item lists and develop two complementary solutions that leverage shared user behavior to maintain the efficiency of our recommendation algorithms within a space budget. The first solution, behavior factoring, factors out user agreements from disagreement lists, while the second solution, partial materialization, selectively materializes a subset of disagreement lists. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our group recommendations and the efficiency and scalability of our algorithms using an extensive set of experiments on the 10 M ratings MovieLens data set.
