Regression testing is an important software maintenance activity to ensure the integrity of a software after modification. However, most methods and tools developed for software testing today do not work well for database applications; these tools only work well if applications are stateless or tests can be designed in such a way that they do not alter the state. To execute tests for database applications efficiently, the challenge is to control the state of the database during testing and to order the test runs such that expensive database reset operations that bring the database into the right state need to be executed as seldom as possible. This work devises a regression testing framework for database applications so that test runs can be executed in parallel. The goal is to achieve linear speed-up and/or exploit the available resources as well as possible. This problem is challenging because parallel testing needs to consider both load balancing and controlling the state of the database. Experimental results show that test run execution can achieve linear speed-up by using the proposed framework.
