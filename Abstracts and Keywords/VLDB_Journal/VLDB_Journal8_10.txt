Advances in high-speed networks and multimedia technologies have made it feasible to provide video-on-demand (VOD) services to users. However, it is still a challenging task to design a cost-effective VOD system that can support a large number of clients (who may have different quality of service (QoS) requirements) and, at the same time, provide different types of VCR functionalities. Although it has been recognized that VCR operations are important functionalities in providing VOD service, techniques proposed in the past for providing VCR operations may require additional system resources, such as extra disk I/O, additional buffer space, as well as network bandwidth. In this paper, we consider the design of a VOD storage server that has the following features: (1) provision of different levels of display resolutions to users who have different QoS requirements, (2) provision of different types of VCR functionalities, such as fast forward and rewind, without imposing additional demand on the system buffer space, I/O bandwidth, and network bandwidth, and (3) guarantees of the load-balancing property across all disks during normal and VCR display periods. The above-mentioned features are especially important because they simplify the design of the buffer space, I/O, and network resource allocation policies of the VOD storage system. The load-balancing property also ensures that no single disk will be the bottleneck of the system. In this paper, we propose data block placement, admission control, and I/O-scheduling algorithms, as well as determine the corresponding buffer space requirements of the proposed VOD storage system. We show that the proposed VOD system can provide VCR and multi-resolution services to the viewing clients and at the same time maintain the load-balancing property.
