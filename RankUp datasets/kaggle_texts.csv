15059,Questions,"PHP framework URL conventions
 A lot of frameworks use URL conventions like /controller/action/{id which is great, but if you need any configuration beyond that, it's up to you to write your own routes. How would you handle URLs like /users/{id}/friends on the backend? (to list all of a user's friends) I'm thinking that in the controller, something like this would be appropriate: Then you would have the following map: I wanted to put the Friend class inside the User class but apparently you can't do that in PHP so this is the best I could come up with. Thoughts? What URL would use for editing your list of friends? /users/{id}/friends/edit could work, but it doesn't seem appropriate, since you should never be editing someone else's friend list. Would /account/friends/edit be a better choice? Where would you put the corresponding code for that? In a friend controller, or a user controller, or a specialized account controller? Bonus question: which do you prefer? /photos/delete/{id or /photos/{id}/delete The answers: So, what I've gathered from the answers is that if the thing is complicated (like friends) but doesn't have its own controller, you can give it one without a model, or if it's not, you should stuff it in with whatever it's most closely related to. Your URLs should not influence where you put your code. Most people seem to think you should stick to /controller/action/{id whever possible, because it's what people are familiar with. No one really commented on the extended class aside from saying it's awkward. Perhaps FriendList would have been a more appropriate class in that case if I really wanted to separate it out.

15074,Questions,"MVC4 StyleBundle not resolving images
 My question is similar to this:  ASP. NET MVC 4 Minification &amp; Background Images Except that I want to stick with MVC's own bundling if I can. I'm having a brain crash trying to figure out what the correct pattern is for specifying style bundles such that standalone css and image sets such as jQuery UI work. I have a typical MVC site structure with /Content/css/ which contains my base CSS such as styles. css . Within that css folder I also have subfolders such as /jquery-ui which contains its CSS file plus an /images folder. Image paths in the jQuery UI CSS are relative to that folder and I don't want to mess with them. As I understand it, when I specify a StyleBundle I need to specify a virtual path which does not also match a real content path, because (assuming I'm ignoring routes to Content) IIS would then try to resolve that path as a physical file. So I'm specifying: rendered using: Styles. Render(~/Content/styles/jquery-ui) I can see the request going out to: This is returning the correct minified CSS response. But then the browser sends a request for a relatively linked image as: Which is a 404 . I understand that the last part of my URL jquery-ui is an extensionless URL, a handler for my bundle, so I can see why the relative request for the image is simply /styles/images/ . So my question is what is the correct way of handling this situation?","mvc4 stylebundle not resolve image my question be similar to this : asp . net mvc 4 minification & background image except that i want to stick with mvc 's own bundle if i can . i 'm have a brain crash try to figure out what the correct pattern be for specify style bundle such that standalone cs and image set such as jquery ui work . i have a typical mvc site structure with / content/cs / which contain my base cs such as style . cs . within that cs folder i also have subfolder such as / jquery-ui which contain its cs file plus an / image folder . image path in the jquery ui cs be relative to that folder and i do n't want to mess with them . as i understand it , when i specify a stylebundle i need to specify a virtual path which do not also match a real content path , because -LRB- assume i 'm ignore route to content -RRB- iis would then try to resolve that path as a physical file . so i 'm specify : render use : style . render -LRB- ~ / content/styles/jquery-ui -RRB- i can see the request go out to : this be return the correct minified cs response . but then the browser send a request for a relatively link image as : which be a 404 . i understand that the last part of my url jquery-ui be an extensionless url , a handler for my bundle , so i can see why the relative request for the image be simply / styles/image / . so my question be what be the correct way of handle this situation ?",254,0.6

 I'm seriously in need of help. My sites are now nearly impossible to use because of massive loads on my server. I'm already a month late on my mortgage and this really isn't helping my situation. I've been working on fixing this intermittent load problem for months (never this bad). I'm suspecting some kind of attack since I'm under DDOS attack a lot! I've been trying to figure out what is causing the load but I'm afraid I just don't have the experience or knowledge to understand all the data I've been looking at.

15091,Questions,"Loadable Kernel Module & Notification Manager
 I've successfully created and installed a loadable kernel module for my development phone. Does anyone know how to make a status bar notification to the user (i. e. Notification / NotificationManager) from the kernel? I understand how to create a service and use Notification / NotificationManager to generate a status bar notification. But how do you make a notification when the event is in the kernel? I'm having a problem bridging the gap. A similar functionality I'm trying to achieve is like connecting to the phone via USB. When the phone detects a USB connection, a status bar notification is produced (and if debugging is enabled, it will tell you that too). How is this done? At some point the kernel sends a signal, but how is the notification generated? The approach I'm going to try and implement is using the NDK. Create a library that listens/waits for a signal from my LKM, then use then create an app that's just a background service that notifies when the signal is received. Is there a more elegant solution for this? And I'd like to not have to recompile the AOSP.

15101,Questions,"SSRS limit length of text but keep full words
 In my table I have essentially 2 columns (many more but there is an obvious left side and right side). One of the fields, FIELD1, on the left side comes from a LookupSet() and each ID can have two items from FIELD1. Using a join(lookupset(), vbcrlf) I am able to get both values for the ID and put it into one cell in the table. This works but with the vbcrlf, the row height is increased. This causes a problem because there is data on the right side which cannot have additional space between it. I did a split(join(lookupset())). getValue(0) for the first row and then the row below it for value 1. With some iif statements to check errors etc, this works. One problem I solved is that the values for FIELD1 can be longer than the width of the cell, but will not take up more than two. I was able to do some substring magic in oracle like: using sorting, I am able to get up to 4 rows of data per ID which I will be able to split the lookupset and get each value into the table. My last problem, and hopefully someone can help with is that when I ge the substring, It can cut off words and the next row will start with the rest of the word. Is there a way, possibly using a regex to make sure to keep words in tact, but also to ensure that the total length returned is &lt; some number of characters?

15117,Questions,"comparing temporal sequences
 I'm trying to wrap my head around this task and wondering if there is a standard way of doing this or some libraries that would be useful. Certain events are tracked and timed at several data sources S1 . SN. The recorded information is the event type and timestamp. There may be several events of the same type sequentially or they may be intermittent. There could be missing events - i. e. when one of the sources misses it, and, vice versa, when a source introduces a false positive.

15149,Questions,"UI Thread gets stuck by using BlockingCollection rapidly? 
 I am about to write an application that gets streaming data from the tcp port, doin some real time calculations on them. All good so far, but the user interface and the marquee progress bar are getting stuck (for irregular, short time periods) when the producer thread is started to do some packaging on the data chunks (see code). I did a lot of thesting and found out that the access to the BlockingCollection bcPort seems to be the problem. bcPort gets constantly chunks from another data-adder thread which is also supposed not to influnce the ui thread. So I dont understand the following: 1. ) Why is the GUI getting stuck when I am using different threads for adding and packaging the chunks? 2. ) Why is this happening when I am using a BC for storing data? Arent these thread safe collections for this certain purpose? By the way: Windows 7 ResourceManager shows 100% CPU usage during streaming, the chunks contain about 2000 float values each, 4 or 5 of them a rushing in per second. I also disabled the Logger but no effect. The consumer and evaluation threads are disabled. Besides the ui thread, there is only a thread called ReceiveAndSave which makes chunks out of incoming float vals (see code, Method Add). the thread Producer is doing some further packaging and enqeues the chunks for the consumer (deactivated).

15151,Questions,"Tough routing problem with Linux, Quagga and OpenVPN
 The Setup I have an OpenVPN server that acts as a central router. It is configured with topology subnet command. Clients are Debian Linux nodes and each have one (or more) subnets directly connected to them. The objective is for any client connected to the VPN to be able to access the subnets connected behind each other client. In order to spread the routing information, we have installed Quagga on the clients and on the server. This works fine using the OSPF daemon. Routing is enabled on all the clients and the server as well. Routing table The routing table on the server is the following : The subnet I want to access is 192. 168. 100. 0/24. The gateway in question responds perfectly fine and I can connect to it alright. I don't think this will be of any use but here is part of the client routing table : Where things start going south Pinging from the server (10. 8. 0. 1) to any hosts (including the VPN client interface) in the 192. 168. 100. 0/24 subnet fails. If I tcpdump the tun interface on the VPN client, I see no relevant package. If I tcpdump the tun interface on the VPN server, I see the package in question being sent out. The real edgy thing is that when I traceroute to a valid IP in the 192. 168. 100. 0 subnet, it doesn't discover any hops (there should be just one). If I traceroute directly to the next hop (10. 8. 0. 4), it responds fine. I really hope I am being clear as this is quite a complex problem.

 I'm building an estimate for a potential client. I'll do some more research if I get the project, but need some ideas for now.

Also, the site will serve up a lot of images and audio. I'm concerned that using strictly a e-commerce platform will give me a lot of obstacles to overcome rather than use just a cart+framework.

This is what a came up with: Convert multiway tree to a trie, i. e. assign the following prefixes to every node in the above tree: Then, reserve a bit array for every possible prefix size and add the parent nodes to be tested against, i. e. if C is added to the potential parent node pool, do: When testing if a node is a descendant of a potential parent node, take its trie prefix, lookup the first character in the first prefix array (see above) and if it is present, lookup the second prefix character in the second prefix array and so on, i. e. testing F leads to: so yes F, is a descendant of C. This test seems to be worst case O(n), where n = maximum prefix length = maximum tree depth, so its worst case is exactly equal to the obvious way of just going up the tree and comparing nodes. However, this performs much better if the tested node is near the bottom of the tree and the potential parent node is somewhere at the top. Combining both algorithms would mitigate both worst case scenarios. However, memory overhead is a concern. Is there another way for doing that? Any pointers greatly appreciated!","o -LRB- 1 -RRB- algorithm to determine if node be descendant of another node in a multiway tree ? imagine the follow tree : i 'm look for a way to query if for example f be a descendant of a -LRB- note : f do n't need to be a direct descendant of f -RRB- , which , in this particular case would be true . only a limited amount of potential parent node need to be test against a large potential descendant node pool . update : when test whether a node be a descendant of a node in the potential parent pool , it need to be test against all potential parent node . this be what a come up with : convert multiway tree to a trie , i. e. assign the following prefix to every node in the above tree : then , reserve a bit array for every possible prefix size and add the parent nod to be test against , i. e. if c be add to the potential parent node pool , do : when testing if a node be a descendant of a potential parent node , take its trie prefix , lookup the first character in the first prefix array -LRB- see above -RRB- and if it be present , lookup the second prefix character in the second prefix array and so on , i. e. testing f lead to : so yes f , be a descendant of c. this test seem to be bad case o -LRB- n -RRB- , where n = maximum prefix length = maximum tree depth , so its bad case be exactly equal to the obvious way of just go up the tree and compare node . however , this perform much better if the test node be near the bottom of the tree and the potential parent node be somewhere at the top . combine both algorithm would mitigate both bad case scenario . however , memory overhead be a concern . be there another way for do that ? any pointer greatly appreciate !",309,1

15168,Questions,"C++ & DirectX - setting shader
 Does someone know a fast way to invoke shader processing via DirectX? Right now I'm setting shaders using D3DXCreateEffectFromFile calls, which create shaders in runtime (once per each shader) from *. fx files. Rendering part for every object ( every patch in my case - see further ) then means something like: This is okay, but the profiler shows weird things - preprocessing (see code) takes about 60% of time (I'm rendering terrain object of 256 patches where every patch contains about 10k vertices) . Actual geometry rendering takes ~35% and postprocessing - 5% of total rendering time. This seems pretty strange to me and I guess that D3DXEffect interface may not be the best solution for this sort of things. I've got 2 questions: 1. Do I need to implement my own shader controller / wrapper (probably, low-level) and where should I start from? 2. Would compiling shaders help to somehow improve parameter setting performance? Maybe somebody knows how to solve this kind of problem / some implemented shader interface or could give some advices about how is this kind of problem solved in modern game engines.

15175,Questions,"Pipelining within Process Groups
 I'm currently reading Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment by Stevens/Rago. Within the process group section of the book, the author discusses how process groups are utilized commonly by shells for pipelining. For example, the argument shown below could have been generated by shell commands of the form: proc1 proc2 &amp; proc3 proc4 proc5 Lots of other resources also discuss the relationship between process groups and pipelining. However, the one thing which I cannot find is an explanation of how the pipelining portion of this is implemented. I know that in Linux shells like Boune-again shell (BASH), processes in a pipeline are executed in parallel -- that is, in the previous example showing proc3 proc4 proc5 , all three of these processes are simultaneously executed. The stdin of proc4 is connected to the stdin of proc3. (I also know that MS-DOS used temporary files and did not execute pipes in parallel, but let's ignore that for the moment). So, I've got proc3, proc4, proc5 all in a process group. Fantastic. How does this actually help with creating the pipelines between them? As far as I can tell, I need to do the following to enable pipelining in a shell which I build: Create N-1 pipelines, where N is the number of processes in thepipelined statement fork() the shell process N times In each forked process, I need to use dup2 to properly set up theshared pipelines Then, after all of the forked processes have confirmation that theyhave all finalized setting up their pipes (likely via some IPC via ashared memory space), each can then run exec() and actually launchtheir respective processes. However, all of the texts which I keep reading act as if process groups provide some magical functionality to create these pipelines -- or they are simply neglecting to mention the procedure I outlined above. Any comments or advice is always appreciated.","pipelin within process group i 'm currently read advanced programming in the unix environment by stevens/rago . within the process group section of the book , the author discuss how process group be utilize commonly by shell for pipelin . for example , the argument show below could have be generate by shell command of the form : proc1 proc2 & proc3 proc4 proc5 lot of other resource also discuss the relationship between process group and pipelin . however , the one thing which i can not find be an explanation of how the pipelining portion of this be implement . i know that in linux shell like boune-again shell -LRB- bash -RRB- , process in a pipeline be execute in parallel -- that be , in the previous example show proc3 proc4 proc5 , all three of these process be simultaneously execute . the stdin of proc4 be connect to the stdin of proc3 . -LRB- i also know that ms-dos use temporary file and do not execute pipe in parallel , but let 's ignore that for the moment -RRB- . so , i 've get proc3 , proc4 , proc5 all in a process group . fantastic . how do this actually help with create the pipeline between them ? as far as i can tell , i need to do the follow to enable pipelining in a shell which i build : create n-1 pipeline , where n be the number of process in thepipelin statement fork -LRB- -RRB- the shell process n time in each fork process , i need to use dup2 to properly set up theshared pipeline then , after all of the fork process have confirmation that theyhave all finalize set up their pipe -LRB- likely via some ipc via ashared memory space -RRB- , each can then run exec -LRB- -RRB- and actually launchtheir respective process . however , all of the text which i keep read act as if process group provide some magical functionality to create these pipeline -- or they be simply neglect to mention the procedure i outline above . any comment or advice be always appreciate .",317,0.8

15204,Questions,"How to enable windows authentication through a reverse proxy? 
 Sorry if it is a duplicate, as I am not a security nor network expert I may have missed the correct lingo to find information. I am working on an application to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses between a web browser and a web server (see  how to intercept and modify HTTP responses on server side? for the background). I decided to implement a reverse proxy in ASP. Net which forwards client requests to the back-end HTTP server, translates links and headers from the response to the properly proxified URL, and sends the response to the client after having extracted relevant information from the response. It is working as expected, except for the authentication part: the web server uses NTLM authentication by default, and just forwarding requests and responses through the reverse proxy does not allow the user to be authenticated on the remote application. Both the reverse proxy and the web application are on the same physical machine and are executed in the same IIS server (Windows server 2008/IIS 7 if that matters). I tried both enabling and disabling authentication on the reverse proxy app with no luck. I have looked for information about it, and it seems to be related to the double-hop problem, which I do not understand. My question is: is there a way to authenticate the user on the remote application through the reverse proxy using NTLM? If there is none, are there alternative authentication methods I could use?

15228,Questions,"Method/IBAction stuck in infinite loop. Still no success
 Now this may sound like my earlier problem/question but I've changed and tried a few things that were answered in my other questions to try to make it work, but I've still got the same problem. I am observing a core data property from within a NSManagedObject sub-class and the method that gets called when the property changes calls another method but in this method it adds Core Data objects which triggers the KVO method which triggers the method again and so forth. Or so it seems, I'm not too sure about that because something different seems to happen, here is the series of events … I click a button syncing with iCal (this in an IBAction with the exact same code thats in the method syncKVO). This sync works fine. I add an object to my outline view. All is well. I change its name which triggers the KVO Declaration (because I changed the 'name' property) which syncs with iCal. Works fine. I delete the object I just added and somehow it triggers the KVO declaration (thus triggering the method) and puts me into an infinite loop . Now for some code. Code inside the NSManagedObject Subclass (called JGManagedObject) … The KVO Declaration (inside the App Delegate) … The Method (also inside the App Delegate)… What I've tried … Filtering the Keypaths that call the KVO Declaration with Detaching and reattaching observers with but with that it works the first time but stops the method the second time saying that it cannot remove the observer because it is not observing, which doesn't make sense because I added the observer again the first time. That is why I left this code out of the actual method else it would stop on the second sync. I'm not sure whats going on with this, I think I've tried everything. Whats gone wrong? Any help would be greatly appreciated.","method/ibaction stick in infinite loop . still no success now this may sound like my earlier problem/question but i 've change and try a few thing that be answer in my other question to try to make it work , but i 've still get the same problem . i be observe a core data property from within a nsmanagedobject sub-class and the method that get call when the property change call another method but in this method it add core data object which trigger the kvo method which trigger the method again and so forth . or so it seem , i 'm not too sure about that because something different seem to happen , here be the series of event ... i click a button sync with ical -LRB- this in an ibaction with the exact same code that in the method synckvo -RRB- . this sync work fine . i add an object to my outline view . all be well . i change its name which trigger the kvo declaration -LRB- because i change the ` name ' property -RRB- which sync with ical . work fine . i delete the object i just add and somehow it trigger the kvo declaration -LRB- thus trigger the method -RRB- and put me into an infinite loop . now for some code . code inside the nsmanagedobject subclass -LRB- call jgmanagedobject -RRB- ... the kvo declaration -LRB- inside the app delegate -RRB- ... the method -LRB- also inside the app delegate -RRB- ... what i 've try ... filter the keypath that call the kvo declaration with detach and reattach observer with but with that it work the first time but stop the method the second time say that it can not remove the observer because it be not observe , which do n't make sense because i add the observer again the first time . that be why i leave this code out of the actual method else it would stop on the second sync . i 'm not sure what go on with this , i think i 've try everything . what go wrong ? any help would be greatly appreciate .",324,0

 I am trying to generate diff file (patch file) and apply this patch to some already deployed folder.

15262,Questions,"How to put text over an image without absolute positioning or setting the image as backbround
 I'm trying to see if it is possible to put some text over an image without using position: absolute or having the image being, the background of an element. The reason for the constraints is that the HTML code is going into an e-mail, and it turns out that hotmail supports neither. I remember that when I first began studying CSS, fiddling around with float-ing text around images I often ended up with the text merrily going all over the image. Sadly, I can't reproduce that behavior. Full story (edited in): I received a fancy layout from the graphics designer. It's basically a nice background picture, with logos linking to websites and what basically is a text goes here area in the middle. As usual in these cases, I'm using tables to make sure that everything stays in place AND works crossbrowser+crossmailclient. The problem arises from the fact that the middle text goes here area is not a white rectangle, but has a some background graphics. Having made some test, it appears that Live Hotmail does not seem to like neither position: absolute or background-image; relative margins are also not good because they'd ruin the rest of the layout.

15280,Questions,"DataSet defined by ReadXmlSchema: why do column datatypes change after filling? 
 I have a process that exports the results of a database call to a CSV file. The data types and file format must match a specific format so the file can be uploaded to an external system. This process has been running for maybe 7 or 8 years on an ASP. NET (. NET 2. 0) webform and suddenly (sometime over the last 6-18 months) it's not working the way it used to. Perhaps after . NET 4. 0 was installed on the client server, or maybe after some other framework update(? ) or windows update(? ) or provider update(? ). Our DLL has not changed in a few years. I'd like to fix this legacy process with the least amount of hacking and slashing possible. There are three data types being exported: integer, string, and decimal. The problem is that all the integer columns are being exported as decimals now. The CSV export library looks at the datatypes of the columns to determine the correct output format, so I use a XSD file to define my DataSet before filling it. Here is a simplified example of the XSD file: The data types defined for each column used to persist after the data was loaded, but now they are reset by the data load. For example: How can I force the integer column to remain an integer after the database call? Or how can I change the datatype after populating the dataset?

 I've been designing an application that requires the use of a scrollbar on a custom view.

I suspect that this isn't a very unusual problem, but to complicate things, I'm not actually adding new objects to my custom view, I'm just drawing Bitmap images on the canvas. The reason this is troublesome to me is when Android inflates the layout, it sets the size to be whatever I tell it (0dip) and as I add the Bitmaps, it simply changes the size to fill the Scrollview; thereby, whenever the Custom View draws an image beyond the current height constraints, instead of scrolling, the app simply cuts the picture off to maintain the current height.

15340,Questions,"How can I pass a property as a delegate? 
 This is a theoretical question, I've already got a solution to my problem that took me down a different path, but I think the question is still potentially interesting. Can I pass object properties as delegates in the same way I can with methods? For instance: Let's say I've got a data reader loaded up with data, and each field's value needs to be passed into properties of differing types having been checked for DBNull. If attempting to get a single field, I might write something like: But if I've got say 100 fields, that becomes unwieldy very quickly. There's a couple of ways that a call to do this might look nice: Which might also look nice as an extension method: Or: In the second instance, the property would need to be passed as a delegate in order to set it. So the question is in two parts: Is this possible? What would that look like? [As this is only theoretical, answers in VB or C are equally acceptable to me Edit: There's some slick answers here.

15349,Questions,"Why does my counter variable not come back to 0 in a multithreaded scenario? 
 I'm building a Windows Service base class to manages the polling off a schedule's table of any pending task and the running them. The Windows service is using the System. Timers. Timer to start the schedule's table polling. I'm setting the ThreadPool. SetMaxThread to 10 before initialising the timer. The delegate method called by the timer keeps the count of the running threads so that it can be used in the OnStop() method to wait for each thread to complete before disposing the service. Often, the service would not stop when I try to stop it from the Windows service management console. If I debug it and add a breakpoint to the OnStop() method I can see that it is not because the numberOfRunningThreads is stuck on a number greater than 0 (often much greater than 10! ). No tasks are running and it stays on that number forever! Firstly, I don't understand how that number could ever be greater than 10, despite the ThreadPool. SetMaxThreads should limit it to 10? Secondly, even if I did not set the maximum number of threads, I would expect the finally block of the PollWrapper's to eventually bring the count back to 0. If the counter stays greater than 0, it can be explained only with the finally block not executing, right! ? How that is possible? And lastly, would you suggest a differently way to limit the Poll to a number of possible concurrent running threads to a fixed number (. NET 3. 5)? Many thanks. UPDATE: After reading Yahia's comments on reentrancy and SetMaxThread I have modified the PollWrapper so that it should always limit the max number of spawned running threads.

15357,Questions,"Save loop deleting one end of many-to-many CoreData relationship
 I've been looking at this one for a while but can't seem to crack it. Its the first many-to-many relationship I have built in CoreData and obviously there is something simple I am missing. I have a screen where I maintain two different Core Data 'entities', the entities are related via a many-to-many relationship. The first entity and the relationships between the first and second entity are maintained on the first tab of the screen and this seems to be working fine allowing me to delete the first entity instances and add/remove relationships between the first and second entities. My problems are on the second tab where I maintain the second entity. They entities display fine and I can update their attributes, however, attempts to delete them results in a never-ending save loop. I believe I have verified the loop by adding an NSLog entry into the willSave method of the second entity's NSManagedObject class.

15371,Questions,"Virtualized Development Environments in Enterprise Networks
 We are attempting to implement a development environment using virtualization for a small team of 4 developers within an enterprise organization. This would allow us to set up separate development, testing, and staging environments - as well as allowing access to new operating systems that are requirements for systems or tools we are evaluating. We re-purposed an existing workstation-class machine, threw in 24GB RAM and RAID-10, and were doing fine until we attempted to get the machine added to the domain. Now we are beginning the war that all enterprise developers since the beginning of time have had to fight - the fight for local control of a development and testing environment. The network and IT admins' have raised concerns ranging from ESX Server is the enterprise standard to servers are not allowed on client VLANs to [fill-in-the-blank is not a skill set currently possessed in the local or enterprise IT organization. We could justify production-class hardware and formal IT support if we had to, but it would take time and involve a whole lot of headache. Even then it might take months to formally get IT resources assigned by treating this as a production system - and even if we did, we would likely lose the local control we need. I imagine that many of you have had similar struggles over developer control of non-production environments - and virtualization in particular - so my questions are as follows: What strategies and arguments have helped you win over the infrastructure (IT &amp; Network) folks to allow these types of silos to exist within enterprises which have standard network and security policies in place that would generally (and understandably) preclude this type of non-(centrally)-managed infrastructure? Have you found this to be a matter of technical justification - or more of a political struggle for control and ownership? If you ended up with a IT-managed development environment, how much of a roadblock has it been for day-to-day development and testing? Has anyone ended up moving their development environment to a disconnected VLAN or entirely separate network to avoid these network access struggles? Also, this is not a Hyper-V vs. ESX holy war (we would be fine with either - but Hyper-V was selected since it is free with MSDN for these purposes [yes, VMWare has free tools too - but the good management tools generally aren't], and would be easier to manage by the local developers in a Microsoft Shop) - so arguments for or against either are outside the scope of this question. This is also less of a virtualization vs. physical hardware - I suppose the same question could be asked without the virtualization component to the equation. Also assume that the dev team has already made assurances to either manage patch management and antivirus, or integrate with the existing enterprise systems if they will support it. This scenario, with different questions, is also  posted on SF to hopefully elicit the opposing viewpoint.","virtualized development environment in enterprise network we be attempt to implement a development environment use virtualization for a small team of 4 developer within an enterprise organization . this would allow us to set up separate development , testing , and staging environment - as well as allow access to new operate system that be requirement for system or tool we be evaluate . we re-purpos an exist workstation-clas machine , throw in 24gb ram and raid-10 , and be do fine until we attempt to get the machine add to the domain . now we be begin the war that all enterprise developer since the beginning of time have have to fight - the fight for local control of a development and testing environment . the network and it admin ' have raise concern range from esx server be the enterprise standard to server be not allow on client vlan to -LRB- fill-in-the-blank be not a skill set currently possess in the local or enterprise it organization . we could justify production-class hardware and formal it support if we have to , but it would take time and involve a whole lot of headache . even then it might take month to formally get it resource assign by treat this as a production system - and even if we do , we would likely lose the local control we need . i imagine that many of you have have similar struggle over developer control of non-production environment - and virtualization in particular - so my question be as follow : what strategy and argument have help you win over the infrastructure -LRB- it & network -RRB- folk to allow these type of silo to exist within enterprise which have standard network and security policy in place that would generally -LRB- and understandably -RRB- preclude this type of non - -LRB- centrally -RRB- - manage infrastructure ? have you find this to be a matter of technical justification - or more of a political struggle for control and ownership ? if you end up with a it-managed development environment , how much of a roadblock have it be for day-to-day development and testing ? have anyone end up move their development environment to a disconnect vlan or entirely separate network to avoid these network access struggle ? also , this be not a hyper-v vs. esx holy war -LRB- we would be fine with either - but hyper-v be select since it be free with msdn for these purpose -LRB- yes , vmware have free tool too - but the good management tool generally be n't -RRB- , and would be easy to manage by the local developer in a microsoft shop -RRB- - so argument for or against either be outside the scope of this question . this be also less of a virtualization vs. physical hardware - i suppose the same question could be ask without the virtualization component to the equation . also assume that the dev team have already make assurance to either manage patch management and antiviru , or integrate with the exist enterprise system if they will support it . this scenario , with different question , be also post on sf to hopefully elicit the oppose viewpoint .",500,0.3333333333333333

15390,Questions,"Why does calling ob_flush() slow down my latency so much? 
 I am writing an application in PHP, and I decided to do some testing on my own to determine how well PHP handles buffers and buffering. Specifically, I wanted to see if manually calling ob_start() and ob_flush() would have a huge effect on my program. I conjured up 10KB of lorem ipsum and went to work. I put a timer in PHP at the start and end of a for loop that writes the 10KB of lipsum (in display: none div blocks) 100 times, for a total of 1MB of data, which I figured would be enough work that random CPU load wouldn't throw off my data too much. Besides the PHP timer, I popped open Chrome's developer tools (F12) and recorded the time and latency field. If I have my terminology correct, the time is the total amount of time the page took to respond, and render, and latency is just the time until the page first received data from the server. So here's the mystery: When I do nothing but write the 10KB of lipsum 100x, my averages are: When I call ob_start() at the very beginning, and ob_flush() at the very end: HOWEVER, and here's the mystery - when I call ob_start() and ob_flush() at the beginning and end of each 10KB block of text, my Chrome-reported latency spikes by 4x. As far as I know, the chrome latency should be cut by 100x, since I'm flushing the buffer 1/100 of the way through the PHP output. I know that the ob_start() and ob_flush() operate on a higher buffer, and they actually flush into a lower buffer, I would expect that lower buffer to flush at the same intervals, meaning I would see about the same latency. My test rig is a very modest Intel ATOM netbook with Nvidia ION graphics, Windows 7 home premium (32-bit) and WAMPserver running Apache 2. 2. 22 with pretty much default settings. I used Chrome 24. 0. 1312. 52 m. CPU load was moderate but not 100% during the tests, and my ram was nowhere near full.

15409,Questions,"Ubuntu: How to I add string to terminal window title from command line? 
 I am working on a Ubuntu VM where i have multiple terminal windows open at the same time. I switch between them many times and it's hard to keep track of which window has which purpose. So what I want to do is to issue some sort of command from the command line that would permanently alter the title of the window. One approach is to modify the following line in . bashrc to, say, add the word FOO to the title: Then I would do source . bashrc . The problem is that I only have one . bashrc and many windows. So if I open two windows one after another without changing the line in . bashrc , I'll have FOO in both of them. So I want to issue a command from each window instead. How do I do that?

15410,Questions,"Rails 3: Chaining `has_many` relations with conditions on the last table, without excessive queries
 I am new to both DBs and Rails (using 3. 2), and I suspect this is a basic question that I'm just having trouble finding an answer for. I'm making an app that tracks articles people submit to journals. So, each user has a number of articles. For each article, they can submit it to a number of journals. The submission object itself keeps track not only of the article being submitted and the journal it's submitted to, but also the date it was submitted, the way it was submitted (email, online system, etc. ), the date a response was received (if any), the response (if any) (e. g. accepted, resubmit, decline). I'm trying to allow a user to view all of their outstanding submissions in one place. So, for each user, I'm trying to query the db to get all submissions belonging to articles that belong to that user, but only returning the submissions for which response is NULL (meaning there is no response yet, and thus the submission is still outstanding). So my models are related like this: Now, for a given user , I think I could do something like and then but that seems pretty inefficient. What probably big, obvious thing am I missing?

15411,Questions,"PHP code for multiple-keyword with weighted-results SQL search
 My question is closely related to this previous post which was quite helpful but I still can't get it working right.  Php MySql Query with Multiple Keyword for Multiple Fields I have &lt; 10, 000 rows (might grow to 20k max) of data in a SQL table titled table with (for example) three fields FIELD1 (varchar) FIELD2 (text) FIELD3 (year4). note: real data includes about 10 to 15 fields and may change. CURRENTLY CODE FUNCTIONS AS FOLLOWS: The following code below (which I got by following a few youtube tutotorials) allows me to search all three fields with one keyword (e. g. dog). If I type in two words into my search box (e. g. dog sled) then one of the three fields must contain the exact phrase dog sled for any results to be returned at all. So if one field has both sled and dog but not in that order the record will not be returned. IDEAL FUNCTIONING: I would like to be able to type a few words into the search box and have the query look for each search word across all three fields. Additionally I would like results with more matching words to be ranked (weighted) higher. (e. g. a search with words dog sled 2005 would give a higher rank to a query that found all three words somewhere across the three fields and give less weight to a query that found only two or one of the words. )Finally, since my database is growing I would like to truncate the results so only 50 results are displayed for any search. Thanks in advance. --Tim UPDATE: I've addressed some early questions I got on this issue below. 1) What are some examples of real-world data that can be found in [field1, field2, field3]? Would it be individual words or entire phrases/sentences/paragraphs? The real world data is about 15 fields including numbers, words, phrases, abbreviations, lists of words, and even paragraphs. They are for something like a library catalog of books and reports and less formal papers and documents. Some fields and examples follow: Year (e. g. 2010) Season (e. g. fall) First_name (e. g. William) Last_Name (e. g. McShane) note: would be great to accomodate appostrophes but not necessary e. g. O'reilly, can't, Smith-Jenkins. Title (e. g. The economic decline of blah blah regions) Description (e. g. this text addresses a wide range of issues on . ) Classification (e. g. 4AB51-45) Phone (e. g. 555-121-5444) Email (e. g. etc. 2. In the design you're looking for, does keyword order still matter? For instance, if field1 = I ate a souffle made from lobster, and I search for lobster souffle, should it work? I'm not so concerned with word order or even phrases. There will likely never be more than 20, 000 records in the entire database and at the moment there are only a few thousand so really a search for just two key words across fields would likely be enough to narrow most searches down to a dozen results. With one key word though it is impossible. there might be 1000 records with 2010 as the year so I can't even search by year without getting a flood of results. The query just needs to find entries with all or some of the words with higher weight given to records that contain more of the keywords. Most of the keyword searches will look for words often in different fields. so i might type (2010 economic airlines Florida taxes) and hope to get records for a about 5 reports written in 2010 that dealt with the effects of taxation on the airline industry that were maybe published by authors in Florida or maybe Florida showed up in another field e. g. a Florida based airline, etc. Sorry for the long winded response. So, to answer the original question. If you search for lobster Souffle is should find a record with a Field1 entry of (I ate a souffle made from lobster). Similary if field one contains (lobster) and field2 contain (souffle) it should find the record and weight it equally since it found two of the search words. And now two design questions: 3. Will you ever add a field4, field5, field6, and so on in the future? The reason I'm asking is that you may want to consider abstracting your search keywords into a separate 'search' table or something like that. It's not 'normalised' (if you're not familiar with the term, normalisation means designing your database so that no piece of data will ever be in two places) but it does make things much more efficient. I can explain that a little more later if you want. I will almost certainly add / remove fields in the future. I don't know what normalization is. 4. I see you're stripping out all characters that aren't alphanumeric (or the space); will you want to be able to deal with apostrophes (like wasn't or O'Ryan), hyphens, and so forth? As mentioned above it would be great to deal with apostrophes and hyphens. I only have the bit in there that strips those out because that is the way it was done for the example on YouTube that I got the idea from. I don't think any search phrases will include words like isn't but might include authors with appostrophes like O'reilly or hyphens like Smith-Galviston.

15420,Questions,"Spring Entity bean not known. Using new Spring 3. 1 packagesToScan property and no persistence. xml
 Another question for my EclipseLink and Spring (MVC and spring-data) version 3. 1. 1 set-up: I'm trying to get JPA working without the use of the persistence. xml file in accordance with  this article . In the article it says: Usually, JPA defines a persistence unit through the META-INF/persistence. xml file. Starting with Spring 3. 1, this XML file is no longer necessary – the LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean now supports a ‘packagesToScan’ property where the packages to scan for Entity classes can be specified. The persistence. xml file was the last piece of XML to be removed – now, JPA can be fully set up with no XML. I understand that if one were making use of the persistence. xml file, all Entity classes here should be declared here. However, I'm trying to make use of the packagesToScan property instead. Below is the full startup log and the error produced after making one request to the servlet which ultimately attempts to create a new user in the database. It doesn't seem to recognise that the User object is an Entity. Since I have little experience with Spring, I was wondering if anyone, firstly can spot a mistake I'm making, but otherwise, knows the best way to debug this. I want to know what Entity objects have been recognised by the EntityManagerFactory. My backup option is to switch to using persistence. xml (haven't tried it yet actually) but I'd like to be rid of that if possible (one less XML file to worry about). UPDATE: I've updated the error log after making the recommended config change to the entityManagerFactory, based on the answer by Sean Patrick Floyd but that did not solve the main issue. What I have also done is tried an alternative way of getting this to work by creating a persistence. xml file (the old and more common way of doing this) and added a small piece of test code within the servlet I access to kick off this functionality. So now I have this bit of code in my servlet: And this persistence. xml file: This actually works so I'm wondering now whether it's a problem with the way the EntityManagerFactory is initialised or something like that.

15427,Questions,"How may a linked list be saved/loaded from a file efficiently using Objective-C? 
 After four weeks of learning Objective-C for the iPhone, my first useful application is almost finished. However, I still need to save several instance variables whenever the current view is changed and to reload them when the view is reopened. I have no trouble loading variables with basic C types like int and BOOL , but am having difficulty with a linked list made of Objective-C objects. The linked list consists of memory accessed by three pointers: startPointer , currPointer , and endPointer . Each element consists of a last pointer, a next pointer, a pointer to a nested linked list ( nestedPtr ), and some variables. My first attempt was to do the following in the loading code: I placed a debug point at the end and all of the variables had the correct values. Actually accessing the values in the code (doing so in the console worked) resulted in *EXC_BAD_ACCESS* messages. Next, I changed the linked list loading lines to the following: The initPointerFromList method: The problem now was that the pointers were all pointing to individual linked lists, so I wrote methods to retrieve the start and end locations of the linked list referred to by currPointer: My question is threefold: Is it necessary to use methods such as initPointerFromList to allocate memory for a loaded linked list? Is there a more efficient way to maintain the relationship between currPointer , endPointer , and startPointer than by searching through the list using the lastElement and firstElement methods? Is there something wrong with the techniques behind the loading code I have presented? Without it, I have no problems; with it, I still get *BAD_ACCESS* messages. I want to know if these messages are tied to the loading code or if to the way I have handled object allocation throughout the rest of my application.

15444,Questions,"Is it possible to have multiple cxf. xml files to configure separate parts of the system? 
 It seems interesting, that nobody asked this before. I have some basic@-questions about the configuration of CXF Clients. We have a Tomcat running our application. This application needs to communicate with a WebService. The implementation of the client is done with CXF, and this implementation is packaged in a JAR-File. Lets say ws-client. jar. It is possible and desirable, that there are other implementations of clients for other webservices, also using CXF. And each WS-Client should be packaged in its own JAR-File. So at the end I'll have our application WAR, containing all other ws-client*. jar I need. And now the question: Where can/may I put the cxf. xml ? Can I put a configuration file in each ws-*. jar? Can a put in addition another in the war file? Or only one cxf. xml file must exist? Which path in the archive is the best? By now I just copy a configuration file in tomcat/webapps/bigApplication/WEB-INF/classes/cxf. xml (probably also not the best place for it). The problem is, I need to do that every time I deploy the application. And I want actually only to configure ws-client. jar, and not all CXF-WS-Clients. So I want to configure things as specific as possible, and in the write place. Any answer is welcome, also Links to the right information, which I didn't find. [UPDATE]As it is a somehow long question, here the questions in the post together: Can I put a cxf. xml file in a jar-archive? Can more than one cxf. xml file exists per application? One in each relevant . jar file? Where is the best path in a jar-file to put the cxf. xml?

15448,Questions,"Did medieval Russia reject islam because of its prohibition against alcohol? 
 Since a long time, I am aware of a historical anecdote about the attempt to convert Russia to islam. I don't know where I first heard the anecdote, I'm pretty sure it was oral, so I had to dig a bit to find notable claims. The anecdote goes something like this: a muslim emissary arrived at the czar to talk about islam. He talked about the religion, the rites, the position of women, etc. etc. , and the czar sounded quite interested. He almost succeeded in convincing the czar, when he mentioned the ban on the consumption of alcohol. Then, the czar pointed out, islam could not be an option in Russia. The Wikipedia page on  Alcoholism in Russia states: Legend holds that the tenth-century Russian prince Vladimir the Great rejected Islam as a state religion for the country because of its prohibition of alcohol. . which is sourced from Primary Chronicle, year 6494 (986) . (I have no idea what that means. ) A semi-quoted reference on the Wikipedia page  Reign_of_Vladimir_and_Christianisation Kievan Rus states: The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. The emissaries visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews and the Muslims, they finally arrived in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because , among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol , and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But, at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there, that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. which is sourced in its entirety as: Janet Martin, Medieval Russia, 980–1584, (Cambridge, 1995), p. 6-7 The first source calls it a legend, and I'm not sure whether the second source is meant to be historical or also more like a story.

15449,Questions,"ClassCastException with multiple wars deployed in Tomcat
 I have two WARs deployed to the same Tomcat 7 instance, and both use CXF + WSS4J. The two apps communicate via SOAP, and WSS4J interceptors handle SAML assertions in the SOAP headers.

15450,Questions,"Is binding objects to angular's $rootScope in a service bad? 
 In angular, I have an object that will be exposed across my application via a service. Some of the fields on that object are dynamic, and will be updated as normal by bindings in the controllers that use the service. But some of the fields are computed properties, that depend on the other fields, and need to be dynamically updated. Here's a simple example (which is working on jsbin here:  ). My service model exposes fields a , b and c where c is calculated from a + B in calcC() . Note, in my real application the calculations are a lot more complex, but the essence is here. The only way I can think to get this to work, is to bind my service model to the $rootScope, and then use $rootScope. $watch to watch for any of the controllers changing a or b and when they do, recalculating c . But that seems ugly. Is there a better way of doing this? A second concern is performance. In my full application a and b are big lists of objects, which get aggregated down to c . This means that the $rootScope. $watch functions will be doing a lot of deep array checking, which sounds like it will hurt performance. I have this all working with an evented approach in BackBone, which cuts down the recalculation as much as possible, but angular doesn't seem to play well with an evented approach.

15455,Questions,"Can a rational Bézier curve take exactly the same shape as a part of the sine function? 
 I'm wondering whether a rational Bézier curve could take exactly the same shape as a part of the sine function. The best way to check this seems like this: Find a part of the sine function such that there is no symmetry anymore in this part, e. g. from $sin(0)$ to $sin({pi over 2})$. In that case, the control points for a quadratic Bézier curve follow from the sine function. Because a Bézier curve is tangent to the control polygon at the first and last points, this results in the points $(0, 0)$, $(1, 1)$ and $({pi over 2}, 1)$. The second point $(1, 1)$ is the intersection of the two tangent lines. When plotting the above: enter image description here Which is pretty close, but I'm looking for an exact representation (if possible). Therefore, the next step is to look to a rational Bézier curve: enter image description here In this case I used the weights [1, 1. 4, 1].

15496,Questions,"Optimum Number of Parallel Processes
 I just finished coding a (basic) ray tracer in C for fun and for the learning experience. Now I want to further that learning experience. It seems to me that ray tracing is a prime candidate for parallel processing, which is something I have very little experience in. My question is this: how do I know the optimum number of concurrent processes to run? My first instinct tells me: it depends on how many cores my processor has, but like I said I'm new to this and I may be neglecting something.","optimum number of parallel process i just finish cod a -LRB- basic -RRB- ray tracer in c for fun and for the learn experience . now i want to further that learn experience . it seem to me that ray trace be a prime candidate for parallel processing , which be something i have very little experience in . my question be this : how do i know the optimum number of concurrent process to run ? my first instinct tell me : it depend on how many core my processor have , but like i say i 'm new to this and i may be neglect something .",97,0
15497,Questions,"Best Strategy for a die game
 You are allowed to roll a die up to six times. Anytime you stop, you get the dollar amount of the face value of your last roll. Question: What is the best strategy? According to my calculation, for the strategy 6, 5, 5, 4, 4, the expected value is $142/27approx 5. 26$, which I consider quite high. So this might be the best strategy. Here, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4 means in the first roll you stop only when you get a 6; if you did not get a 6 in the first roll, then in the second roll you stop only when you roll a number 5 or higher (i. e. 5 or 6), etc.","best strategy for a die game you be allow to roll a die up to six time . anytime you stop , you get the dollar amount of the face value of your last roll . question : what be the best strategy ? accord to my calculation , for the strategy 6 , 5 , 5 , 4 , 4 , the expect value be $ 142/27approx 5 . 26 $ , which i consider quite high . so this might be the best strategy . here , 6 , 5 , 5 , 4 , 4 mean in the first roll you stop only when you get a 6 ; if you do not get a 6 in the first roll , then in the second roll you stop only when you roll a number 5 or high -LRB- i. e. 5 or 6 -RRB- , etc.",122,0

15522,Questions,"Android GridView not updating
 I have a GridView arranged in a 3x4 matrix, each item in the GridView is a FrameLayout containing an ImageView and a Textview. Initially the TextViews are set to display the letter X. When clicked on, the letter is changed to Y. It works on all the GridView items except the first one. If I click on the first one (top left) then nothing happens, no matter how long I wait. If I then click anywhere else on the Android emulator screen (even outside the GridView itself), at that point the top left GridView item changes to Y. I have a gut feeling it is something to do with the fact that getView in ImageAdapter is being called several times with position=0 before the GridView is rendered, the sequence is as follows: 0012345678910110 Now maybe that's just how Android works, I don't know, but it seems strange. If anyone can help me out I'd appreciate it so much. UPDATE: it appears the problem is related to MyView=convertView in getView(), if I simply remove this and always create a new View (as if convertView is null always) then the problem no longer exists. Now I don't think this solution will be an issue as I don't use scrolling and the number of Views created should be 12 (i. e. a 3x4 GridView), but if anyone can explain the correct solution to the problem it would help a lot, thanks.

15524,Questions,"From a ruby developer's perspective (minimalist coder, etc), what is the most efficient way to deal with javascript on rails 3? 
 I've recently been watching some screencasts in order to get a feel for the javascript programmer perspective and coding process, and have been a little frustrated, especially coming from a ruby background, seeing all of this stuff done by hand, and with such odd naming conventions! So there is CoffeeScript, which I'm looking at with a fair amount of interest. Then there is RJS, but then Rails 3 has pulled support for that and I don't want to learn an outdated method. Then there is Go, which I'm not sure has enough support yet and just don't know enough about yet. Then of course all along here most of the time here there's jquery. But should I even use jquery? Can I get around writing javascript entirely? Would/could the circumvention attempt be fruitful? I'm not asking for a therapy session or a bashing session, so if you're wound up like that please don't post here. I'm actually intrigued by javascript. If only because all of the cool programmers are talking about functional languages now. But I don't want to waste my time. And all I really need to have is a robust way for passing information from rails/active-record to the javascript in a variety of ways. And I need to know what I'm doing with javascript. In fact that's mainly all I need to do. I need to be able to look at javascript, or coffeescript, or go, or whatever, and see it like I see ruby, which looks like an orchestra if it's written right. So my questions are these: a. ) It seems like a lot of javascript tutorials are produced by javascript programmers who don't know what exactly it is they are doing. What are some good tutorials that involve a developer going over code, thinking aloud (CORRECTLY) about Javascript? Also rails+javascript materials. Sorely lacking. There is not a single book out on Rails 3 + Javascript, which is crazy because so much has changed since 2006's Ajax on Rails. What resources do you know of other than lots of time? b. ) RJS, Coffeescript, etc v. Javascript + Jquery (or alt. )What are the weaknesses of using the 'higher-level' abstracted languages and what are the benefits. And most importantly for me, a rails user, what is the solution that is most likely to be compatible with rails 2 years from now? ? RJS sounded like a great idea. But it used prototype right? Is there an RJS which is Rails 3 ready? ** And, again, guys, the book issue. Seriously this is a nice little opportunity for a knowledgable rails/javascript developer. Nothing has been released by the major publishers explicitly on Rails and Javascript since 2006! ! !

 I have heard people state that method swizzling is a dangerous practice. Even the name swizzling sugests that it is a bit of a cheat.  MethodSwizzling is modifying the mapping so that calling selector A will actually invoke implementation B. One use of this is to extend behavior of closed source classes. Can we formalise the risks so that anyone who is deciding whether to use swizzling can make an informed decision whether it is worth it for what they are trying to do. E. g. Naming Collisions . If the class later entends its functionality to include the method name that you have added, it will cause a huge manor of problems.

 I recently bought a Canon 7D and Ive noticed that occasionally the AF points are orange. What conditions cause this? It seems like it is a warning of some sort. Usually when the camera focuses on a subject, one or a number of AF points are shown in the viewfinder outlined in black. Under certain circumstances the AF points flash orange once just as it achieves focus before they turn black. I've suspected that this might mean that focus was not properly achieved, yet the focus confirmation indicator in the bottom right of the viewfinder is solid and not flashing. According to the manual, that means that focus has been positively achieved. I have read through the entire section on auto focusing and I have not found mention of the orange vs black AF points. I can scan around my living room with the camera and against certain subjects I get these orange AF points.","what do orange af point mean on a canon dslr ? i recently buy a canon 7d and ive notice that occasionally the af point be orange . what condition cause this ? it seem like it be a warning of some sort . usually when the camera focus on a subject , one or a number of af point be show in the viewfinder outline in black . under certain circumstance the af point flash orange once just as it achieve focus before they turn black . i 've suspect that this might mean that focus be not properly achieve , yet the focus confirmation indicator in the bottom right of the viewfinder be solid and not flash . accord to the manual , that mean that focus have be positively achieve . i have read through the entire section on auto focus and i have not find mention of the orange v black af point . i can scan around my living room with the camera and against certain subject i get these orange af point .",166,0.6666666666666666

15551,Questions,"Revision Tracking Graph
 Define the Revision Tracking Graph (RTG), which is an oriented graph (without circles) where each node x has a set C(x) associated with it. C(x) contains all edges on all paths from a node 0 ( C(0) = { ). Each edge can be in a set at most once! You can also describe this data structure by the rules for its growth: Start with node 0 with associated empty set C(0) = { = creating new object For any node x create a new node y where (x, y) is oriented edge from x to y and C(y) = C(x) union (x, y) = versioning and branching For any nodes f and t, create node r, where (f, r) and (t, r) are oriented edges and C(r) = C(f) union C(t) union (f, r), (t, r) = merging Note: You can see there is no mathematical difference between creating new version and a branch. It is a semantical difference depending on whether there is already an edge leading from the node or not. Base node is defined as a node b, such as C(b) = C(f) intersect C(t) , where f and t are nodes representing two versions to be merged. Simple Merge equation Result=To + (From-Base) = means that if we subtract every edge in C(b) from C(f) and add all edges in C(t) we get a resulting C(r) minus (f, r) and (t, r) edges exactly. No edge would appear twice and all edges in C(f) and C(t) would be represented. = 3-way merge Complex merge equation Result = To + Sum(i=1. n) for (Fi-Bi), where Fn = From . Each edge can be in exactly one of the sets To, (Fi-Bi). For n=1 this turns into a simple merge equation. In case there exist no base in simple case, we might find sequence of F, B nodes to fit the complex equation. (1+2n)-way merge I have actually several questions pertaining to this data structure. I am posing the first 3 for frame of mind, as I already know the answers. And I believe question 4 directly leads to answering question 5, which I really try to get answered. Prove there can be no circles in the graph Prove that for certain graphs there are such nodes F, T for which base cannot be found as specified in simple equation. Create algorithm to find B in simple case where n = 1. Prove that for each RTG and each pair of nodes F and T, there is a set of n pairs of nodes Fi, Bi, where i=1. n to fit the complex merge equation.

15553,Questions,"Multithreaded server using threadpool
 I'm planing a multithreaded server (SCGI to be precise). Now, I know that the traditional approach using one thread per connection is not very scalable. I also don't want to use something fancy like libevent, as this is a hobby project and I prefer not to have lots of dependencies in my codebase. The approach I'm thinking of is to use a threadpool and let one thread listen to the network to queue up any request coming in. The threads managed by the pool then dequeue the requests, receive the data and respond respectively. This way, I wouldn't have the overhead of constant thread creation while still being able to serve many request in parallel.

15556,Questions,"Pass object pointer in drag/drop operation
 Is it possible to pass the pointer to an object in a drag and drop operation? Here is the scenario. I have an 'NSArray' of custom objects. For arguments sake we'll say this is a list of person objects. The list is tied to an NSTableView via an NSArrayController . The NSTableView is a drag source and I have an NSView as a drag destination. When implementing drag and drop I can easily get the name of the currently selected person(s) from the NSArrayController as an NSString in the drag process and pass it to the receiver in the NSView . However, I would like to be able to pass a pointer to the person object so the receiver has access to the entire object. The problem seems to be that the drag operation creates a new instance of a person object and does not make a reference to the selected person object despite implementing the required methods in the person model. As a result I get a person object at the destination, it just isn't populated with the data from the object. I ideally I want the object pointer because the NSView will make use of the object reference in order that any updates to the object itself are reflected in both the NSView and the NSTableView (and everywhere else the object is used). Is it even possible to use the object reference in a drag and drop operation or do I need to pass some custom reference that is an iVar of the person object and then do a lookup once it arrives at the destination? (This would seem a little archaic to me considering how much object referencing Obj-c has). I understand that a target could accept a drag operation from outside the application, but specifying the operation as a local operation would account for this would it not?

15592,Questions,"How to remove elements by substrings from a STL container
 I have a vector of objects (objects are term nodes that amongst other fields contai a string field with the term string) After some processing and calculating the scores these objects get finally stored in a vector of TermNode pointers such as A resulting list of this vector, containing up to 400 entries, looks like this: What I try to do is to cleanup that final list for substrings also contained in phrases inside the terms list. For example, looking at the above list snippet, there is the phrase 'knowledge discovery' and therefore I would like to remove the single terms 'knowledge' and 'discovery' , because they are also in the list and redundant in this context. I want to keep the phrases containing the single terms. I am also thinking about to remove all strings equal or less 3 characters. But that is just a thought for now. For this cleanup process I would like to code a class using remove_if / find_if (using the new C++ lambdas) and it would be nice to have that code in a compact class. I am not really sure on how to solve this. The problem is that I first would have to identify what strings to remove, by probably setting a flag as an delete marker. That would mean I would have to pre-process that list. I would have to find the single terms and the phrases that contain one of those single terms. I think that is not an easy task to do and would need some advanced algorithm. Using a suffix tree to identify substrings? Another loop on the vector and maybe a copy of the same vector could to the clean up. I am looking for something most efficient in a time manner. I been playing with the idea or direction such as showed in  std: : list erase incompatible iterator using the remove_if / find_if and the idea used in  Erasing multiple objects from a std: : vector? . So the question is basically is there a smart way to do this and avoid multiple loops and how could I identify the single terms for deletion? Maybe I am really missing something, but probably someone is out there and give me a good hint. Thanks for your thoughts! Update I implemented the removal of redundant single terms the way Scrubbins recommended as follows: I could'nt use the C++11 lambda syntax, because on my ubuntu servers have currently g++ 4. 4. 1 installed. Anyways. It does the job for now. The way to go is to check the quality of the resulting weighted terms with other search result sets and see how I can improve the quality and find a way to boost the more relevant terms in conjunction with the original query term. It might be not an easy task to do, I wish there would be some simple heuristics. But that might be another new question when stepped further a little more : -) So thanks to all for this rich contribution of thoughts!","how to remove element by substring from a stl container i have a vector of object -LRB- object be term node that amongst other field contai a string field with the term string -RRB- after some processing and calculate the score these object get finally store in a vector of termnode pointer such as a result list of this vector , contain up to 400 entry , look like this : what i try to do be to cleanup that final list for substring also contain in phrase inside the term list . for example , look at the above list snippet , there be the phrase ` knowledge discovery ' and therefore i would like to remove the single term ` knowledge ' and ` discovery ' , because they be also in the list and redundant in this context . i want to keep the phrase contain the single term . i be also think about to remove all string equal or less 3 character . but that be just a thought for now . for this cleanup process i would like to code a class use remove if / find if -LRB- use the new c + + lambdas -RRB- and it would be nice to have that code in a compact class . i be not really sure on how to solve this . the problem be that i first would have to identify what string to remove , by probably set a flag as an delete marker . that would mean i would have to pre-proces that list . i would have to find the single term and the phrase that contain one of those single term . i think that be not an easy task to do and would need some advanced algorithm . use a suffix tree to identify substring ? another loop on the vector and maybe a copy of the same vector could to the clean up . i be look for something most efficient in a time manner . i be play with the idea or direction such as show in std : : list erase incompatible iterator use the remove if / find if and the idea use in erase multiple object from a std : : vector ? . so the question be basically be there a smart way to do this and avoid multiple loop and how could i identify the single term for deletion ? maybe i be really miss something , but probably someone be out there and give me a good hint . thanks for your thought ! update i implement the removal of redundant single term the way scrubbin recommend as follow : i could ` nt use the c + +11 lambda syntax , because on my ubuntu server have currently g + + 4 . 4 . 1 instal . anyway . it do the job for now . the way to go be to check the quality of the result weighted term with other search result set and see how i can improve the quality and find a way to boost the more relevant term in conjunction with the original query term . it might be not an easy task to do , i wish there would be some simple heuristic . but that might be another new question when step far a little more : - -RRB- so thanks to all for this rich contribution of thought !",520,1

15600,Questions,"Does a long internal stylesheet affect SEO? 
 I'm building a site with a lot of similar css between pages. I've decided that a good approach would be to have the css generated as strings by php functions (with parameters) and outputed as an internal stylesheet in every page that i serve. The benefits: this way if i make a change it will reflect throughout the entire site without having to maintain duplicates i can send only the necessary css for a certain page it's better than having small css files and sending a lot of css headers at inclusion the possibility that the content might be displayed before the stylesheet is loaded is gone i can calculate dimensions by using parameters i can create a layer that will minify the result received from these functions or serve cached minified css I haven't seen this done anywhere else unfortunately so i'm thinking that this might be because of SEO.

I don't know how to get grub2 configured correctly, on the restored disk. Currently, my running system is on /dev/sda, with /boot on /dev/sda1 and / on /dev/mapper/desktop-root. (I'm using logical volumes. ) This configuration has been running successfully for several years. My restore is on /dev/sdb, with /boot on /dev/sdb1 and / on /dev/mapper/desktop2-root. All of the files have been restored, and /etc/fstab has been edited, on the restored drive, to reflect the changed logical volume name and the new UUID for /boot. But I only have grub installed on /dev/sda, so /dev/sdb is not bootable. I'm not looking to do anything fancy.

This talk though is frankly over my head for where I am at right now, and was wondering if someone could break down what he is meaning by this: The easiest source of metadata comes from the HTTP headers. Inside the handleReadFromStream: eventType: method, use CFReadStreamCopyProperty to copy the kCFStreamPropertyHTTPResponseHeader property from the CFReadStreamRef, then you can use CFHTTPMessageCopyAllHeaderFields to copy the header fields out of the response.

15698,Questions,"Fundamental Objective-C question. driving me crazy
 Its been a long time since I've done any programming. Used to be 'ok' at reading C &amp; C++. never wrote much. I have an extremely simple Class that I want to use to manipulate the contents of an Array (using NSMutableArray ). The Array needs to persist as an Object so I can make multiple updates to it during a single run of my program (not worried about storing state data to disk yet) Here is my problem. I am not clear on where/when I should Alloc/Init my Array object so that it will be in a usable state each time a button is clicked on my iPhone's View. I am trying to create a SubClass of ViewController that includes an Array as an instance variable, which can then be referenced in the code that responds to button clicks from the View. I've tried 3 approaches I've tried to just reference the array instance variable in a method I've written as part of the same class. No Alloc/Init anywhere in this version of code. When I call the addObject function it appears to fail because the array object has not been allocated/initialized. I've also tried to Alloc/Init an instance of my array object in the viewWillDisplay method. The Xcode compiler complains that my newly allocated object is never used. For kicks, I've done an alloc/init within the scope of the 'button click' method i'm writing. but of course that allocates a new instance each time I click my button.

If we do further selection on &lt; node1&gt; then one might expect that the XPath-root now is this node, but this is incorrect, the root is still the same as in the original XmlDocument. Here's an example: Is there any way to fix the root of xnSubRoot so that I can use the XPath I want? The reason for my question is because I have a case where I'm calling a webservice that returns an XmlNode where the OuterXml-property shows a structure of /Data/SubElement/.  and so on, but when running XPath /Data then null is returned, only /SubElement works, i. e. the XPath-root seems to be one level lower than the actual document-root. I'm sure there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for this, or that I'm missing something vital. However I really can't seem to find anything, even though I've read (VS. 80). aspx (VS. 80). aspx . N. B. I do realize that it would be possible to use the XPath //subroot/elm, but then I might also get other elements further down in the XML structure.","change the xpath-root of an xmldocument in . net -LRB- c -RRB- ? when select from an xmldocument by e. g. the xpath-method selectsinglenode we get an xmlnode that consist of the first matching node , let call it &lt; node1 &gt; . if we do further selection on &lt; node1 &gt; then one might expect that the xpath-root now be this node , but this be incorrect , the root be still the same as in the original xmldocument . here ' an example : be there any way to fix the root of xnsubroot so that i can use the xpath i want ? the reason for my question be because i have a case where i 'm call a webservice that return an xmlnode where the outerxml-property show a structure of / data/subelement / . and so on , but when run xpath / data then null be return , only / subelement work , i. e. the xpath-root seem to be one level low than the actual document-root . i 'm sure there be a perfectly reasonable explanation for this , or that i 'm miss something vital . however i really ca n't seem to find anything , even though i 've read -LRB- vs. 80 -RRB- . aspx -LRB- vs. 80 -RRB- . aspx . n. b. i do realize that it would be possible to use the xpath / / subroot/elm , but then i might also get other element far down in the xml structure .",218,0.6

 I have a Class / API that uses an IQueryable&lt; FirstClass&gt; data source however I wish to expose an IQueryable&lt; SecondClass&gt; , where SecondClass is a wrapper class for FirstClass that exposes nearly identical properties, however for various reasons needs to inherit from an unrelated base class.

15721,Questions,"Reverse-Engineering - Beginner unable to set breakpoints and keygen
 I like security as a hobby and I not so often I read and play with a few simple KeyGen games and I enjoy it. Reversing and KeyGen is very interesting but I'm a beginner and my questions are probably very dumb but I will be very thankful if you could help me. Until the moment I have reversed simple keygen applications using techniques such as: Look for string text reference to find the interesting code area. Keygen fishing. And bypass IsDebugPresent check. Yeah, I know, really basic stuff. Here is a video similar to what I do in general…  Just for learning sometimes I try to reverse a few small and medium application that I buy for Windows and looks like simple products without many protections. This is a software that I acquired 2 months ago and the whole installation is around 50MB. One of the motivations to try apply my basic knowledge here is because I like to see if what I learned in keygens really work in real-life, my experience that medium softwares are much harder since keygens are very small and easy to find the routines that you want. : ) * Just to keep it very clear, I have a license for this program and my intention is only learn and increase my knowledge. Since I have no commercial intention in break it or create any damage I will not disclosure the application - I hope you understand. * OK, let's go. The application consist of one main executable (~33MB), 6 DLLs (very small ones and some of them are libeay32. dll, etc) and around 90 . xsd files (XML format). My first step was try to identify the programming language used and if a packer was present, please, see screenshots below:   It really appears to be developed in Delphi, with CFF I confirmed it. Also, there is no section that points for an packer looking at CFF information and EXE Information and RDG also say it's clean. However, RDG found IsDebugPresent and pointed for an protection software as you may see. However, I'm not sure if it's a false-positive. On my application the serial is entered in a field like that:  And once I enter a wrong serial number (30 chars long) I get a message like that:  I guess it's not a MessageBox, or at least it's very custom one. For this kind of messages should I keep breakpoints at MessageBoxA, etc? Or there is a different API? Below is a screenshot once I attach to the application running:  When I press run at OllyDB it's what I get:  Here is a list of SEH chain:  Here are the Windows available, including the one that I would like to disassemble, examine and put a breakpoint:  However it fails to debug, see below, please:  Is it some kind of protection? How to disable this part of code, put breakpoints, etc? Looking at Text String References I'm able to see just partial messages and not the one displayed on my custom MessageBox.  Also, There are many parts that looks like an message that will be completed on the fly, for example A chave informata esta which means They key entered is or Chave incorrecta n which means Wrong key at.  Additionally, I noted that are parts of the application when some texts are not stored as a TextString, instead I see char by char in sequence at OllyDb creating a few strings (also not very useful to me). If I define a breakpoint in any of these TextStrings it's what happen - an exception:  Is it a protection? Any idea how to bypass it? From here the only thing that I'm able to do it pass control to the application and all is over. : ( Also, if I refuse to pass control to the application and I continue with F7/F8 I get something like that:  It ends with an instruction not recognized by OllyDB. Any idea? I also tried to set breakpoints in Names from User32. dll such as GetDlgItemTextA and GetDlgItemTextW since I believe they are the APIs used to read my entered serial number. The strange thing is that they are exported and not imported as demonstrated below. Is it normal?  Once I created the breakpoint and stated stepping into I got this exception again and I was forced to pass control to application and game over again. : (  I was thinking it could be some basic Anti-debugging protections, so I enabled aadp4olly and Olly Advanced with many options but it was unable to solve the issues, so, I'm not so sure anymore about what is issue is.

15732,Questions,"Serving images through HTTP. Load balanced highly available architecture
 I'm planning a system for serving image files from a server cluster with load-balancing. I'm battling with the architechture and whether to save the actual image files as blobs in the database or in filesystem. My problem is that, the database connection is required anyways as the users need to be authenticated. Different users have access only to contents of their friends and items uploaded by themselves. Since the connection is required anyways, maybe the images could be retrieved from there aswell? Images should be stored with no single point of failure. And obviously, the system should be fast. For database approach: The database is separate from rest of my application, so my applications main database won't get bloated by all the images. Database would be easy to scale as I just need to add more servers to the cluster. Problem is, that I've heard this might be a slow system from a website with millions, even billions of photos. For filesystem: I would be really interested in knowing how could one design a system, where the webservers are load balanced, and none of them is too important for the overall system. All the servers should use a common storage, so they can access the same files in the cluster. What do you think? Which is the best solution in this case?

15736,Questions,"Why would you use nested InvokeLater calls in Java? 
 I'm refactoring some code that runs a multi-stage process. Each step is inside a nested java. awt. EventQueue. invokeLAter . call. It looks a little like this: I am new enough at Java that I don't get the point of nesting these calls to add 'jobs' to the EDT, and I'm not 100% confident with fiddling with these calls either. I think I understand what the invokeLater call does, and what each step does. Please correct me if this understanding is wrong: invokeLater is used to add some invocation to the list of jobs to be done in the Event Dispatch thread. Java then deals with when/how each invocation is done, ensuring that the EDT and in turn the GUI doesn't lock as it performs jobs 'in the background'. Nesting these calls says to me that we should queue a set of jobs, one of which is to queue something, which will queue some jobs. one of which is to queue something. But the first inner invocation is only ever queued once the previous job is done. Everything occurs sequentially (this is in line of my understanding of the whole process), but I don't see why you would use nested requests to queue jobs to do so. I would have, if I was writing this from scratch, have simply created functions for each invocation and called them in turn. I recognise, being only a novice at Java I am probably missing something huge that makes this nesting important. But there is no documentation of this, and no commenting in the code about the nesting. What am I missing?

15744,Questions,"Has a Dependent Type always a Type? 
 I am experimenting with dependent types. Lets assume the following short notation: Now according to the generalized type system a triple (s1, s2, s3) regulatesthe formation of product types. We have the following formation rule: In the examples I have seen, the sorts are always atomic. Would it be possibleto have a dependent sorts s2? The question came up, when I tried to model the formation rule as a dependenttype itself. My idea was that (px: A. B) is a shorthand for a lambda expressionwhere p is some predefined constant: The following p's work: 1) p of type (py: o. ((y - o) - o)) it does the same as the triple (o, o, o), and thus says thatif a is a proposition and b is a proposition, then a - b isalso a proposition (implication). This is how it works: 1) p of type (py: i. ((y - o) - o)) it does the same as the triple (i, o, o), and thus says thatif x from some set A and B(x) is a proposition, then (px: A. B(x))is a proposition (forall quantifier). This is how it works, assuming q : nat - o: But I don't see how it should work when s2 is dependent. That s2 isdependent would mean that we have: Have some logical systems where s2 is dependent already been studied? What would be the formation rule? I guess we cannot go along with p : (py: s1. ((y- s2(x)) - s3)) because x has not the right scope. Any ideas? Bye (*)H. P.

15755,Questions,"Unwanted evaluation in assignments in Mathematica: why it happens and how to debug it during the package-loading? 
 I am developing a (large) package which does not load properly anymore. This happened after I changed a single line of code. When I attempt to load the package (with Needs), the package starts loading and then one of the setdelayed definitions “comes alive” (ie. Is somehow evaluated), gets trapped in an error trapping routine loaded a few lines before and the package loading aborts. The error trapping routine with abort is doing its job, except that it should not have been called in the first place, during the package loading phase. The error message reveals that the wrong argument is in fact a pattern expression which I use on the lhs of a setdelayed definition a few lines later. Something like this: When I attempt to load the package, I get: As you see the passed argument is a pattern and it can only come from the code line above. I tried to find the reason for this behavior, but I have been unsuccessful so far. So I decided to use the powerful Workbench debugging tools . I would like to see step by step (or with breakpoints) what happens when I load the package. I am not yet too familiar with WB, but it seems that , using Debug as…, the package is first loaded and then eventually debugged with breakpoints, ect. My problem is that the package does not even load completely! And any breakpoint set before loading the package does not seem to be effective. So…2 questions: can anybody please explain why these code lines come alive during package loading? (there are no obvious syntax errors or code fragments left in the package as far as I can see) can anybody please explain how (if) is possible to examine/debugpackage code while being loaded in WB? Thank you for any help.

15771,Questions,"Should we always eliminate calculated attributes, even when it is a critical and complicated calculation? 
 The third normal form of database design asks you to remove functional dependencies. It seeks to eliminate redundancy, removing from a table any attributes (fields) that can be calculated from the other fields. For instance, when you make a reference to another entity, you only store its key. You don't store replicas of attributes from these referred entities, because that would mean having to update them every time you change the referred entity. Another situation is an attribute such as height. You want to know the height of a person, but in your application you may like to know it in different units: meters, feet, astronomical units. But you don't store all of these values, you should remove calculated fields, so you only leave one of them (meters, of course), and you calculate the transformed values on the fly, when you need it. You also don't store something like age, you calculate them from date of birth. In this case the fact that age changes with time also plays a role. If you don't do this your data will soon be incorrect, unless you keep updating it constantly. Now suppose you have a social network that displays the astrological sign of each user. For each user we display his or her sign, which is calculated from the date and time of birth, and also from the astrological tradition of the user's choice (e. g. Western or Chinese). Calculating someone's sign is a pretty specialized and involved calculation, but is nevertheless something you can just call from an astrological library and calculate. How would you design this database, would you remove this functionally dependent attribute, or would you calculate the user's sign once, or every time she updates her date of birth, then store it in the database and forget about the possibility of calculating a sign in the rest of your system, or would you enforce the 3NF rule with an iron fist? And how do you see the potential benefit of being able to tweak a user's sign if she insists that her sign should be different from the one that your algorithm is calculating? Now suppose a new application. You are building a system for the Army, that chooses possible occupations for new conscripts. Part of your system is a huge bad-ass pattern recognition machine, developed at ORNL, that tells you what occupations will be allowed for the conscripts, based on a whole lot of data that comes from your database. This pattern recognition method looks at each person's height, date of birth, medical records, school transcript, and it also looks at a long list of answers the person gave to one of two questionnaires. It also takes in consideration evaluation questionnaires filled by higher-rank officers, and the analysis that is made looks at all of the conscripts from each year at the same time, to come up with a bunch of parameters for, say, a feed-forward neural network. This neural network is simpler than the whole of the pattern recognition system, but it is still a pretty involved calculation, not just a temperature unit conversion. Nevertheless, you can see it as a black box, and it can tell you the fate from each of your conscripts when you pull his record form the database. At a specific date in the Army's calendar, the analysis is made, the ANN parameters are found, and now you can run the black box and tell each conscript what he will be doing for the next one year or two. It's a pretty important thing. You will be deciding people's occupations, you will be sending some people to operate ovens at the kitchen, and other to drive tanks. Everyone will be logging in the Army's network to check out their occupations, and see the result in their personal webpages. Now, the little black box is there, and it outputs this important value based on the attributes pulled from your database. The attributes and parameters will probably never change, and the calculation of the conscript's destiny will probably be always correct, always the same value form the first day. But would you really leave that outside the database, just to follow the remove calculated attributes rule? This is not just some calculation of age, astrological sign or temperature conversion. The pattern recognition system is indeed a path to calculate an attribute. But would you really like to keep that inside your system forever, re-calculating this hugely important thing over and over again? Or would you consider it better to calculate everything once, and forget that this magical black box exists? I mean, just run all of this crazy pattern recognition code once some day, then pick the results, and record them in the database. When someone logs in to see the output from his analysis, make it so the query is just a boring data-fetching procedure, and leave all the pettern recognition excitement for another time. Another more palpable situation: You run a web store like Amazon. You have a pattern recognition method to recommend books to people, that is fed from a user's record in your DB. Would you keep running the thing all the time you need the current recommendations, or would you treat the pattern recognition box as something separate from the rest of the system, just feeding its results to the database from where it can be read by other programs? Wouldn't it be nice to have a control, for example, to make sure that you are not switching recommendations at an awkward moment? . Don't worry too much about computational burden, assume excellent memory and computational resources. TL; DR -- Do you think the rule of removing calculated attributes should never be broken, or would you say it is OK to store in the database the results from very important attributes, that are calculated by very complex and delicate pattern recognition methods? Aren't there situations where we should just pretend that you actually cannot perform the calculation on demand, and just leave recorded there these results, that won't be updated anyway?","should we always eliminate calculated attribute , even when it be a critical and complicated calculation ?

 I have to implement a solution where two date ranges can overlap each other. within the overlapped dates, I have to count how many days overlap each other. Once I know the overlapped days I can calculate a total figure based on the price that's attached per day. A scenario would be that A customer is booking a hotel Customer booking dates - 17/02/2011 to 26/02/2011 Normal price (All year) - 01/01/2011 - 31/12/2011 (price per day : $30. 00) Special Offer 1 dates - 01/01/2011 to 19/02/2011 (price per day : $20. 00) Special Offer 2 dates - 17/02/2011 to 24/02/2011 (price per day : $10. 00) In the above scenario, the proposed algorithm should work out the cheapest offer that the date ranges overlap and work out the price for the booking. If there is no special offer available it uses the normal price. So for the first two days the system should get the price from special offer 1 as it's the cheapest available price. Next 5 days should be Special offer 2 price and for the next 2 days it'll be normal price. I'd be grateful to see both SQL(using MS-SQL Server) or Code base answers to get the diffrenet views.

Also, there are a handful of commits which span all projects (license updates, etc. ). Thankfully, at least, there are no merges!

15801,Questions,"Memory usage of php-cgi processes is growing steadily
 I'm trying to set up a web server on a VPS. My problem is that memory usage of php-cgi processes increases over time even though the website is not receiving any traffic at all. (it is behind a firewall for the time being) The VPS has 360MB RAM. I'm using Debian Lenny 32bit and its lighttpd and php5-cgi packages. Apart from some config changes (listed below), I'm using the stock setup by Debian. The website is based on Drupal. Using Drupal's devel module, I can tell that memory usage of PHP scripts is less than 20KB on average, and it never exceeds 8MB. Here are the relevant parts from the output of ps aux : Is it normal to have php-cgi this large? Is it possible to estimate php-cgi memory usage based on settings? Any tips for reducing memory consumption of php-cgi processes? Searching for known memory leaking bugs didn't yield anything relevant. And I'd be surprised if the default Debian packages/config had such an obvious memory leak. Other users on the same host do not have this problem. What I've done so far is set PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS to a low value so that php-cgi processes are recycled quickly. When I use ab to simulate high load, this works very well. Processes die quickly before they grow higher than 10MB. However, under low-to-medium load, all processes grow steadily (because of load balancing) and most of them consume 28MB+ simultaneously, putting my VPS at risk of swapping. Please note than even without any sort of traffic, the processes grow steadily. I can reduce the number of php-cgi processes, but this feels like a workaround more than a fix. I'd be surprised if php-cgi normally grew like this. Also, summing the total RSS numbers for php-cgi processes gives: Yet, free -m gives the following output: Am I missing something? How come the used memory (without buffers) is lower than the total resident memory of php-cgi processes on the host? I have the following PHP extensions: php5-cgiphp5-commonphp5-curlphp5-gdphp5-mysqlphp5-xcache xcache. size is set to 24M. It used to be 32M but reducing it didn't help. xcache. var_size is set to 0. The remaining plugins are using the stock configuration. The xcache admin pages shows that xcache is using less than 1MB. PHP's memory_limit is set to 32M. Here is my FastCGI config: I'm using more-or-less the stock lighttpd. conf that ships with Debian. Please let me know if there is any other data that I can provide. Any help is appreciated. I've been trying to troubleshoot this for days.

15802,Questions,"WCF REST client with TransferMode=Streamed - logging entire (raw) http requests/responses
 This is on . Net 4, full framework. I'm trying to make a simple winforms app that will make some simple WCF REST calls. It's using ChannelFactory and the service contract interface. Of the ~20 methods in the interface, 2 of them involve Stream (an upload and a download method) so the service side (and currently also the client side) using TransferMode=Streamed. My goal is to include the full HTTP request and response (much like you would see in ethereal/wireshark, or fiddler, or whatever), with headers, in a textbox of the winforms app (just to show what went over the wire) In trying to use the built-in diagnostics (via SvcConfigEditor) and my own (via implementing IClientMessageInspector and then IEndpointBehavior to add the inspector, then channelFactory. Endpoint. Behaviors. Add to add the behavior : ), I'm having 2 issues: When doing request. ToString() or reply. ToString() in BeforeSendRequest and AfterReceiveReply, it only gets the 'body' and not the headers. Digging around in the objects in the debugger it looks like the reply has them in reply. Properties[@httpResponse@], but the request's request. Properties[@httpRequest has an empty Headers property even though Fiddler shows headers for Content-Type, Host, Accept-Encoding, and Connection. It seems like there's likely a better way to get the 'raw' message that I'm missing (and if there's not, someone probably knows an existing chunk of code to 'reconstruct' the raw one from the Message) Since the transfer mode is Streamed, the 'body' part just shows up as the string '. stream . ', both in SvcTraceViewer (and the 'raw' svclog - even with logEntireMessage=true) and when doing a ToString(). If the mode is Buffered instead, it shows the actual body fine. I tried making a copy with reply. CreateBufferedCopy(int. MaxValue); but that then caused the actual WCF call to fail with an InvalidOperationException: This message cannot support the operation because it has been copied. One fallback would be to move the client to Buffered and just change to StreamedRequest for the one upload call and StreamedResponse for the download call (but I'd have to do that programmatically AFAICT, as it's set at the binding level in the config and I don't see anyway of doing it via attributes on the calls), which would take care of the 'body' part and leave me with just the get the http request headers (issue 1, specifically request. Properties[@httpRequest@]. Headers being empty) to deal with, but I'm hoping there's some way of logging the 'raw' messages without doing so, leaving the TransferMode as Streamed.

15807,Questions,"Composer, minimum-stability and dependencies of dependencies
 I'm in quite a pickle with a new project and Symfony 2 dependencies using composer. First some situation, i install the symfony/framework-standard-edition v2. 1. 5 using composer. This yields a composer file that has these requirements and no minimum-stability node. This works fine, it installs all the latest stable versions, just as it is supposed to. Next, I add a bundle -  This bundle depends on doctrine/doctrine-fixtures-bundle in dev-master@() And that bundle depends on doctrine/data-fixtures with * () Now when i run composer update in the project, it tells me that there is nothing to satisfy the doctrine/data-fixtures dependency. Either a typo in the name, or no stable version available since the minimum-stability defaults to stable. It does want to install the doctrine-fixtures-bundle in dev stability, since putting dev-master automatically puts this dependency in dev stability. But this does nothing for the deps of this dep, they keep wanting to install as stable since that is my minimum-stability. At this point i can fix this, by adding doctrine/data-fixtures: dev-master or with dev to my composer. json in the project. But since this is only one example (knpmenubundle, fosuserbundle, etc etc) i will have to manually go and add all deps of deps that don't install to my own composer file. Another solution would be dropping minimum-stability of my project to dev, but at that time all my deps, including the stable ones like Symfony2, will install their dev version and not the tagged release.","composer , minimum-stability and dependency of dependency i 'm in quite a pickle with a new project and symfony 2 dependency use composer . first some situation , i install the symfony/framework-standard-edition v2 . 1 . 5 use composer . this yield a composer file that have these requirement and no minimum-stability node . this work fine , it install all the late stable version , just as it be suppose to . next , i add a bundle - this bundle depend on doctrine/doctrine-fixtures-bundle in dev-mast @ -LRB- -RRB- and that bundle depend on doctrine/data-fixture with * -LRB- -RRB- now when i run composer update in the project , it tell me that there be nothing to satisfy the doctrine/data-fixture dependency . either a typo in the name , or no stable version available since the minimum-stability default to stable . it do want to install the doctrine-fixtures-bundle in dev stability , since put dev-mast automatically put this dependency in dev stability . but this do nothing for the dep of this dep , they keep want to install as stable since that be my minimum-stability . at this point i can fix this , by add doctrine/data-fixture : dev-master or with dev to my composer . json in the project . but since this be only one example -LRB- knpmenubundle , fosuserbundle , etc etc -RRB- i will have to manually go and add all dep of dep that do n't install to my own composer file . another solution would be drop minimum-stability of my project to dev , but at that time all my dep , include the stable one like symfony2 , will install their dev version and not the tag release .",251,0.3333333333333333

 Question: Is there a general method, which would let me determine if a laptop can support 2x external monitors? Context: I’m shopping for a laptop, which would support my 2 main modes of operation. In desk mode , I do many hours of design work with OrCAD, Altium, SolidWorks, Visio; also write code in Visual Studio and Eclipse. For that, I’d like to have 2x large external monitors. If needed, monitors can be connected through dock station. If it's possible to choose between portrait and landscape orientation of monitors, that would be a bonus. In field mode , I still need to run CAD packages, but only to look-up and tweak things occasionally. Field mode happens in vanilla indoor environments, so ruggedness and ingress protection are not needed. It would be nice if the laptop had a small footprint, like a 13” laptop perhaps. At the same time, weight and thickness of the laptop are not a problem for me. Of course, I also wonder if this is realistic at all. Update: I'm checking looking into  Maxtor DualHead2Go , which was suggested in several other threads. Update: Found something curious. The hp 120W Advanced Docking Station has 2x DisplayPorts (  HP%20120W%20and%20230W%20Advanced%20Docking%20Stations source ). enter image description here Item 11 on the drawing. Sounds like there ought to be an hp laptop, which would do 2x external monies. Could these DisplayPorts be daisy chained inside docking station? Update: Lenovo Mini Dock Plus also has 2x DisplayPort enter image description here Lenovo had also put together a  brief on multiple monitor setups (  PDF version ).

15825,Questions,"java. util. UUID. fromString not checking length
 When I looked into the implementation of java. util. UUID. fromString , I found that it doesn't check for the UUID length. Is there any particular reason for this? It only checks the components separated by -. Should it also throw IllegalArgumentException when length is not 36? Currently, without the length checking, numbers are automatically prepended with 0's if less than the component length or shifted if more. The downside is, if one entered a UUID string with a missing digit, it is accepted as valid and prepended with 0. This is hard to debug. For example, this 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789ab becomes 12345678-1234-1234-1234-0123456789ab. Notice the '0' added? And this 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abcd becomes 12345678-1234-1234-1234-23456789abcd with the '1' removed. To push this even further, the string 1-2-3-4-5 will also be treated as valid and becomes 00000001-0002-0003-0004-000000000005.

15843,Questions,"Understanding the binary xls file-format
 I'm trying to read the contents of a xls-file without the use of any xls-libraries but having problems doing so. I'm trying to use information I found  here . It has a little step-by-step instruction of how to read the file. Also using this  xls-file-specification . I'm not sure if I even do this step correctly: 3, Open the Workbook stream and scan for the first instance of a BOF record. This is the beginning of the Globals substream. According to the file-specification or this page with a  list of the record-numbers , I should be looking for for 2057(0809h) but the whole file doesn't contain that record anywhere(also using a hexa-editor when trying to find it). But then I read this part on page 20 in the specification: Byte Swapping Excel BIFF files are transportable across the MS-DOS/Windows and Apple Macintosh operating systems, among others. To support transportability, Excel writes BIFF files where the low-order byte of the word appears first in the file, followed by the highorder byte. If I understand that correctly (not sure that I do) big endian of the words are used, so that what I'm looking for is actually 2312(0908h). This makes the impression of being correct as it is found very early in every file i try. So then over to the next step: 4, Read the Globals substream, loading the BoundSheet8 records and the SST into memory. For more details, see Globals. I look for 133(8500h) and it's found shortly after BOF, good. But the problem lies in the two next steps: 5, From the BoundSheet8 record that corresponds to the substream you want to open, read the first 4 bytes, which contains the lbPlyPos FilePointer. 6, Go to the offset in the stream specified by the lbPlyPos FilePointer. This is the BOF record for the worksheet. So the following 4 bytes is a pointer that points to a position in the file I should go to. But reading those bytes in any order gives me a number that is larger than the whole file. And also, this part confuses me: This is the BOF record for the worksheet.  Wasn't that what I found in an earlier step? Hmm. Sorry for my rambling. And I hope I make sense and that someone would be willing to help me a little. Update: Okay, I've gotten a little further with this. It's quite confusing to me but it seems that each record is also read as big endian, ie the last variable in the record is the one that is positioned earliest in the file. Though I don't know if it applies to values with variable length? So, looking at  this , the values of variable length are listed as the last one in a record. But obviously they can't come as the first in the file because there would be no way to know how many bytes to read in if that info comes after it? Anyway, if I ignore this value, and and skip 2 bytes for dt and A/unused and read the following 4 bytes as a uint it turns out as 1130 in my case. Adding that to the pos of the first BOF gives me the exact position of the sheet-BOF. And that cant be a coincidence, right? Now the next problem arises. After that BOF-record the index-record is supposed to follow immediately. But no matter in what way I read in the bytes it still makes no sense.

 Let's say I have an entity called MyItem. It can be included in many parents, like SomeCollection and SomeOtherCollection.

 The question sounds very simple but I couldn't find a way to check if a track uri is correct.

Now if user made a typo on the spotify track uri and tried to play spotify: track: 5Z7ygHQo02SUrFmcgpwsKQ (the last character Q is a typo, should be W ).

15864,Questions,"On the semantics of the gamma distribution
 Good Morning. I have recently been faced with modeling a quantity that is best modeled via a Gamma distribution. I have noticed that, in the characterization of the distribution via the parameters $k$ and $?$, the mean of the distribution is $k?$, whereas the top of the distribution, representing the point that is sampled with the highest probability, is found at point $?( k - 1)$. This contradicts my intuition. If the mean represents the expected value of the distribution, then why is it not placed at the top of the distribution, much like in the normal distribution? Thanks, Jason","on the semantics of the gamma distribution good morning . i have recently be face with modeling a quantity that be best model via a gamma distribution . i have notice that , in the characterization of the distribution via the parameter $ k $ and $ ? $ , the mean of the distribution be $ k ? $ , whereas the top of the distribution , represent the point that be sample with the high probability , be find at point $ ? -LRB- k - 1 -RRB- $ . this contradict my intuition . if the mean represent the expect value of the distribution , then why be it not place at the top of the distribution , much like in the normal distribution ? thanks , jason",107,0.3333333333333333

15878,Questions,"How to balance binary branches and repair shorthand triangles in LFG style c-trees using tikz-qtree
 I have modified the example from the tikz-qtree documentation to form this LFG style c-tree, but am having difficulty balancing the binary branches in general, and the IP branches and roof/triangle DP 'the cat' in particular. My question is how to control the vertical distance between each mother and daughter node so that branches can be made reasonably parallel to each other when comparing level to level? And how to fix the upside-down shorthand DP triangle, and also shorten the width of both triangles to better match the text width? Would very much appreciate suggestions. Alan Munn: Yes, exactly. I would prefer to have the DP of 'the cat' lined up horizontally with the VP just as you say. In general what I would like to do is to make the left branch from IP to DP shorter but parallel with the other leftwards branches: that is, parallel to VP to V-zero and PP to P-zero leftwards branch and ditto with all the rightwards branches. I guess my question is: how do you shorten or lengthen each single branch of the c-tree from each mother node to each daughter node?

15884,Questions,"How to prevent automated request? 
 I was wondering how to set up a system in which an authenticated user could send, with a simple graphical interaction (cliccking a button or so) a non-replayable request/message to the server from an application or a web page. It's crytical there's must not be a way to set up an automated system that replaces user interaction automating the request as this would totally break up my entire project. Moreover, as this action must be frequently repeated, it should not implement boring stuff like chaptas or so. A pratical example: let's say the web page, shown after the login, displays a button that sends the server a request. How can I be sure the request was sent because the user actually clicked the button and it wasn't some sort of bot that forged the message? Is that even possible to check?

15901,Questions,"How do I reduce over 1000 links programatically in a jump menu? 
 Ok, so maybe my search syntax is wrong here, this could have very well been covered in stackoverflow but i've been unable to find anything after hours of searching. Be warned, I am a novice developer when it comes to this type of stuff and would appreciate any guidance, help or pointers to accomplish the goal. I'm open to suggestions of any type! : ) So, I have a site  On this site we have a popular feature called a jump menu which allows a user to quickly navigate directly to the page which contains the anime series they would like to see an episode in. Essentially we have every series on the site (over 1000) broken down in an a-z list. When a user hovers over a letter, the menu will drop down and display all series that begin with that letter. A user can then go to the series they'd like to view and click on it to go directly to the page. The issue with this is SEO. We are being penalized due to the number of links on the page. What we need to accomplish is the same (or better) functionality while reducing the links loaded in the page. If we could come up with a way to create the menu and have the link itself not be served until its clicked on I believe that would resolve the issue. What is the best strategy for doing this? I am no expert by any means, but I was thinking that putting all the links in mySQL and then calling the link as its clicked would be ok, but a friend cautioned me that it would cause a performance hit. I have also reviewed material which indicates you can do the same thing using an array to store the links and then call them as they are needed using PHP. I grasp the concept of doing that but could use a stub type example to get me started. The site is built on Wordpress with a completely custom template / theme. Someone has commented that the topic wasn't researched. Unfortunately I've spent lots of time researching it, the problem is that I think I'm using the wrong terminology to describe what I need to find. If anyone would care to give me the terminology or a good place to conduct further research (even a few keywords! ) I will be MORE than happy to go do that.

15903,Questions,"Entity Framework 4. 1 Integration Unit Tests
 First, a few caveats: We are building a small/medium sized system that is anticipated to have a lifespan of 2-5 years (relatively short). The system is being developed with Entity Framework 4. 1, Code First, MVC3. We are trying to push our team towards unit testing / TDD. It is something that we have not done, but we recognize its value so are taking baby steps in that direction. With all of that in mind, we have decided to build unit tests with Visual Studio 2010's built-in testing framework. We are NOT using the repository pattern or mocks. This is to reduce the complexity and time spent building the unit tests. Each unit test is really more of an integration test - we have a 'test' database that gets initialized each time the tests are run, and each test uses the same controllers that the views use to get as close as we can to real-world behavior of the system. When commenting or answering this question, please do not attack this approach . I am well aware that this is not TDD in its purest form nor is it the ideal pattern for testing units of work. We are doing it this way to get our feet wet with the technology and try to get the most bang for our buck in terms of time spent building the unit tests. The Problem: We are building a lot of unit tests that store an object via a controller, then retrieve the object from the database through the controller to verify that it was stored correctly and that it comes back through our controller the way we would expect. Here is an example: The error we are getting is this: Test method WebObjects. Tests. Controllers. OperatingCompanyControllerTest. Edit_Post_Saves_OperatingCompany_In_DB_When_OperatingCompany_Is_Valid threw exception: System. InvalidOperationException: An entity object cannot be referenced by multiple instances of IEntityChangeTracker. I am pretty sure this is occuring because the entity in question isn't being detached from the context of the first controller, and when we reinstantiate it and try to edit the same entity, it thinks another context still has ahold of it. The reason we are reinstantiating the controller is to ensure that the entity is being pulled back from the database and not just being returned from the cache of the DbContext (please correct me if I am wrong here, but I believe that is what would be happening if we didn't reinstantiate). We were able to get this to work by explicitly detaching every object from the context after every call to SaveChanges as well as detaching when we query objects via the context in our controllers, but I don't want to do that just to get our unit tests to work, plus I am sure it would be a significant performance hit. The Question: Is there some better way to perform this type of integration test with our controllers?","entity framework 4 . 1 integration unit test first , a few caveat : we be build a small/medium size system that be anticipate to have a lifespan of 2-5 year -LRB- relatively short -RRB- . the system be be develop with entity framework 4 . 1 , code first , mvc3 . we be try to push our team towards unit testing / tdd . it be something that we have not do , but we recognize its value so be take baby step in that direction . with all of that in mind , we have decide to build unit test with visual studio 2010 's built-in testing framework . we be not use the repository pattern or mock . this be to reduce the complexity and time spend build the unit test . each unit test be really more of an integration test - we have a ` test ' database that get initialize each time the test be run , and each test use the same controller that the view use to get as close as we can to real-world behavior of the system . when comment or answer this question , please do not attack this approach . i be well aware that this be not tdd in its pure form nor be it the ideal pattern for test unit of work . we be do it this way to get our foot wet with the technology and try to get the most bang for our buck in term of time spend build the unit test . the problem : we be build a lot of unit test that store an object via a controller , then retrieve the object from the database through the controller to verify that it be store correctly and that it come back through our controller the way we would expect . here be an example : the error we be get be this : test method webobject . test . controller . operatingcompanycontrollert . edit post save operatingcompany in db when operatingcompany be valid throw exception : system . invalidoperationexception : an entity object can not be reference by multiple instance of ientitychangetracker . i be pretty sure this be occur because the entity in question be n't be detach from the context of the first controller , and when we reinstantiate it and try to edit the same entity , it think another context still have ahold of it . the reason we be reinstantiat the controller be to ensure that the entity be be pull back from the database and not just be return from the cache of the dbcontext -LRB- please correct me if i be wrong here , but i believe that be what would be happen if we do n't reinstantiate -RRB- . we be able to get this to work by explicitly detach every object from the context after every call to savechange as well as detach when we query object via the context in our controller , but i do n't want to do that just to get our unit test to work , plus i be sure it would be a significant performance hit . the question : be there some better way to perform this type of integration test with our controller ?",490,0.2
15904,Questions,"Does it still make sense to think about effective code on micro scale in C++? 
 Early in my programming career I was in love with pointer twiddling, lean code, doing everything with as little layers of abstraction as possible and so on. The code was very C like I would say, close to metal and clever. Time has passed, I have a lot more experience, and I'm noticing my attitude towards the code has changed. And with changed, I mean, I don't want to bother about everyday stuff anymore, unless it's super easy to do. If there is a string concatenation, I will never choose raw pointers deliberately. If I need to concatenate stuff, I might add a quick guess reserve for an STL container, but I don't want to bother with preallocated buffers, C like APIs, caches, avoiding hitting the disk, or trashing. I know realloc might happen from time to time, including all the heap locks, extra copying and so on, but I don't even bother anymore. Maybe, it is because I have spent some time early in my career where I thought of a clean and beautiful schemes with worker threads that process large amount of trivial data, only to find out later that the whole unoptimized realloc+copy+realloc+copy+realloc+copy+5 layers of wrappers doesn't even register in profiler. Maybe it's because I've seen how compilers sometimes do magic. However, such trivial things do add up. When all your code base uses higher order constructs, it has chances that there will be some realloc all over the place, or cold disk hits, that can cause a general perception of a slow application. Sort of like WTL vs MFC. Or how you instantly know that the application is written in Java when you launch it. But is it really? Is there any comparisons of software that's using only very lean and smart code vs software that uses generic containers all over the place? Would you even feel a difference if the string allocation throughout the program would be using prereserves and smart moves vs lazily calling string. append in every place where there is a need for such functionality? Do you try to implement mitigation solutions for such simple, well known things that are cheap to execute anyway? Can software turn into bloatware just because extra caution is not applied to every line of code?","do it still make sense to think about effective code on micro scale in c + + ? early in my programming career i be in love with pointer twiddle , lean code , do everything with as little layer of abstraction as possible and so on . the code be very c like i would say , close to metal and clever . time have pass , i have a lot more experience , and i 'm notice my attitude towards the code have change . and with change , i mean , i do n't want to bother about everyday stuff anymore , unless it ' super easy to do . if there be a string concatenation , i will never choose raw pointer deliberately . if i need to concatenate stuff , i might add a quick guess reserve for an stl container , but i do n't want to bother with preallocated buffer , c like apis , cache , avoid hit the disk , or trash . i know realloc might happen from time to time , include all the heap lock , extra copying and so on , but i do n't even bother anymore . maybe , it be because i have spend some time early in my career where i thought of a clean and beautiful scheme with worker thread that process large amount of trivial data , only to find out later that the whole unoptimized realloc + copy + realloc + copy + realloc + copy +5 layer of wrapper do n't even register in profiler . maybe it ' because i 've see how compiler sometimes do magic . however , such trivial thing do add up . when all your code base use high order construct , it have chance that there will be some realloc all over the place , or cold disk hit , that can cause a general perception of a slow application . sort of like wtl v mfc . or how you instantly know that the application be write in java when you launch it . but be it really ? be there any comparison of software that ' use only very lean and smart code v software that use generic container all over the place ? would you even feel a difference if the string allocation throughout the program would be use prereserve and smart move v lazily call string . append in every place where there be a need for such functionality ? do you try to implement mitigation solution for such simple , well know thing that be cheap to execute anyway ? can software turn into bloatware just because extra caution be not apply to every line of code ?",395,0.3333333333333333
15905,Questions,"Pixel-perfect vertical alignment of image-rendered TeX snippets? 
 What is the most accurate way to automatically calculate the text baseline in an image that has been rendered from a TeX snippet—so that the rendered image can be given proper vertical alignment in a block of text? My current approach (which isn’t working in all cases): Here’s an example of what I’m trying to do. Note that these are screenshots of a web page (HTML + CSS + Latin Modern fonts for web) and not of a TeX document . The web page is mostly paragraphs of text, but contains embedded PNG images (rendered TeX snippets) for the formulas involving square roots. Here’s how I want it to look: big good But here’s what I’m getting. big bad The second—the smaller—square root formula is aligned correctly, and it was done automatically. I’m calculating the baseline by first rendering a snippet consisting of only a “. ” character, and then by measuring the height of the resulting image, after cropping away everything below the “. ”, this tells me how much I need to lower the image (using CSS’s vertical-align style) in order to align it with the surrounding text’s baseline. This works well for formulas that aren’t too tall. Where it fails is, well, taller formulas, as shown above. In the case of the first—the larger—square root formula, it needs to be lowered less than normal, because it extends higher than normal. My calculations for this are currently wrong, and I’m wondering how I can fix this. Alternatives? What are some ways of measuring the baseline (in pixels) of a snippet? I can’t really use documentclass{standalone for this because it crops the page as tightly as possible, which produces different image heights for $x$ , $X$ , and sqrt{x . I’m thinking I may need to render a calibration snippet consisting of two blank lines prior to a lone . (or perhaps a bottom-aligned horizontal rule) instead of just a single . character—but that seems a bit kludgey. Is there a way to coax TeX into not placing a formula lower on the page when it is taller than standard text? That is, is there some way I can cause a formula at the top of a page to protrude upward into the top margin? A second problem I also noticed that I’m seeing sub-pixel alignment problems. Below are screenshots scaled up to 400% actual size: This formula is ¾ pixel too low: too low At first, I thought I was calculating the vertical-align value wrong, so I manually moved it up by one pixel, but then it turns out that it's ¼ pixel too high—which means the problem lies within the image rather than the alignment value: too high I suspect this is fixable by making sure I round the image heights up to the nearest multiple of 4 before I downsample them for embedding in the page. Just wondering if anyone has tackled this problem before, and has any tips. I’m encouraged by these results so far, but doing this correctly turns out to be a lot more subtle than I expected it would be. Naïvely, when I first started this, I hadn’t considered tall formulas or even vertical alignment at all.","pixel-perfect vertical alignment of image-rendered tex snippet ? what be the most accurate way to automatically calculate the text baseline in an image that have be render from a tex snippet -- so that the render image can be give proper vertical alignment in a block of text ? my current approach -LRB- which be n't work in all case -RRB- : here ' an example of what i 'm try to do . note that these be screenshot of a web page -LRB- html + css + latin modern font for web -RRB- and not of a tex document . the web page be mostly paragraph of text , but contain embed png image -LRB- render tex snippet -RRB- for the formula involve square root . here 's how i want it to look : big good but here 's what i 'm get . big bad the second -- the small -- square root formula be align correctly , and it be do automatically . i 'm calculate the baseline by first render a snippet consist of only a `` .

15945,Questions,"jQuery AJAX mangling character enoding on the way to the server
 I have looked through several question about AJAX and character encoding, but I can only seem to find questions about the response's encoding, but not where the data sent to the server's encoding. I am sending a form serialized using jQuery to the server. PHP then saves this form's fields to a database. The database uses latin1-swedish-ci. The page with the form uses iso-8859-1.

I have tried to use utf8_decode() server side, but this converts it into a question mark.

15951,Questions,"boost with icu u32_regex memory leak / cache on Win32
 When using the boost regex class with the optional ICU support enabled (see  boost documentation for details) I seem to get a memory leak or rather some sort of caching of memory happening which I cannot seem to reset / cleanup. Has anyone else seen this and maybe knows of a way of clearing the cache so that the boost unit test framework will not report a memory leak? The details for my problem are : - Though I did try this with a boost 1. 42 with icu 4. 2. 1 which I happened to have built on my system with same results so don't think its a problem which would be solved by changing to boost 1. 47 icu 4. 8. 1 which are the latest versions. Compiling the following code (Test. cpp) : - Which can be compiled from a command line by: - With the appropriate paths to headers / libs for your machine Copy the appropriate boost dlls to the directory containing test. exe if they are not pathed in (boost_regex-vc100-mt-gd-1_45. dll and boost_unit_test_framework-vc100-mt-gd-1_45. dll) When test. exe from above steps is run I get : - I'm guessing that icu is actually the culprit here since there it has its name at the start of the 2nd block. Just doing the 1st test (ie just creating a standard regex not a u32_regex) has no memory leaks detected. Adding multiple u32_regex's to the test does not result in more memory being leaked. I attempted to clean up the icu cache by using the u_cleanup() call as per the  icu documentation see the ICU Initialization and Termination section. However I am not very familiar with the icu library (actually am only using it because we wanted unicode aware regex support) and can't see how to get the u_cleanup() call to actually clean up the data when ICU is being loaded by the boost regex dll. Just to reiterate the problem appears to be : - boost regex in a dll compiled with optional icu support (I'm pretty sure this uses a static link to icu but may be wrong here) If I link to icuuc. lib in test program so that I can call u_cleanup() this doesn't appear to affect the memory held by the instance of ICU loaded via the boost regex library (well it would be rather odd if it did) I can't find any calls in regex library which allow me to ask it to cleanup the ICU data which is really where we want to make the call.","boost with icu u32 regex memory leak / cache on win32 when use the boost regex class with the optional icu support enable -LRB- see boost documentation for detail -RRB- i seem to get a memory leak or rather some sort of caching of memory happen which i can not seem to reset / cleanup . have anyone else see this and maybe know of a way of clear the cache so that the boost unit test framework will not report a memory leak ? the detail for my problem be : - though i do try this with a boost 1 . 42 with icu 4 . 2 . 1 which i happen to have build on my system with same result so do n't think its a problem which would be solve by change to boost 1 . 47 icu 4 . 8 . 1 which be the late version . compile the follow code -LRB- test . cpp -RRB- : - which can be compile from a command line by : - with the appropriate path to header / lib for your machine copy the appropriate boost dll to the directory contain test . exe if they be not path in -LRB- boost regex-vc100-mt-gd-1 45 . dll and boost unit test framework-vc100-mt-gd-1 45 . dll -RRB- when test . exe from above step be run i get : - i 'm guess that icu be actually the culprit here since there it have its name at the start of the 2nd block . just do the 1st test -LRB- ie just create a standard regex not a u32 regex -RRB- have no memory leak detect . add multiple u32 regex 's to the test do not result in more memory be leak . i attempt to clean up the icu cache by use the u cleanup -LRB- -RRB- call as per the icu documentation see the icu initialization and termination section . however i be not very familiar with the icu library -LRB- actually be only use it because we want unicode aware regex support -RRB- and ca n't see how to get the u cleanup -LRB- -RRB- call to actually clean up the data when icu be be load by the boost regex dll . just to reiterate the problem appear to be : - boost regex in a dll compile with optional icu support -LRB- i 'm pretty sure this use a static link to icu but may be wrong here -RRB- if i link to icuuc . lib in test program so that i can call u cleanup -LRB- -RRB- this do n't appear to affect the memory hold by the instance of icu load via the boost regex library -LRB- well it would be rather odd if it do -RRB- i ca n't find any call in regex library which allow me to ask it to cleanup the icu data which be really where we want to make the call .",438,0.5

15955,Questions,"server-side caching strategy for user filtered results
 I have a situation at  www. zipstory. com (beta) where I have n-permutations of feeds coming from the same database. For example, someone can get a feed for whatever city they are interested in and as many of these cities all together so its all sorted by most recent or most votes. How should I cache things for each user without completely maxing out the available memory when there are thousands of users at the same time? My only guess is don't. I could come up with a client-side caching strategy where I sort out the cities results but this way I could still cache in a one-size fits all strategy by city. What approaches do you suggest? I'm in unfamiliar ground at this point and could use a good strategy. I noticed this website does not do that but Facebook does. They must be pulling from a pool of cached user-feeds and plucking them in client-side. Not sure, again I'm not smart enough to figure this out just yet. In other words. Each city has its own feed. Each user has an n-permutation of city feeds combined. I would like to see possible solutions to this problem using c and ASP. NET Adding to this Febuary 28th, 2013. Here's what I did based on your comments so THANKS! . For every user logging in, I cache their preferred city list The top 10 post results are cached per city and stored in a Linq based object When a user comes in and has x cities as feeds, I go through their city list loop then check if city postings are in cache, if not, I get from DB then populate the individual posting's html into cache along with other sorting elements. I recombine the list of cities into one feed for the user and since i have some sorting elements on the linq object, i can resort them in the proper order and give back to the user This does mean there is some CPU work everytime regardless as I have to combine city lists into a single city list but this avoids going to the database every time and everyone benefits in faster page response times. The main drawback is since I'm not doing a single query UNION on cities before, this requires a single query per city if each was not cached but each city is checked if cached or not individually so 10 queries per 10 cities would only happen if the site is a dead zone.","server-side caching strategy for user filter result i have a situation at www . zipstory . com -LRB- beta -RRB- where i have n-permutation of feed come from the same database . for example , someone can get a feed for whatever city they be interested in and as many of these city all together so its all sort by most recent or most vote . how should i cache thing for each user without completely max out the available memory when there be thousand of user at the same time ? my only guess be do n't . i could come up with a client-side caching strategy where i sort out the city result but this way i could still cache in a one-size fit all strategy by city . what approach do you suggest ? i 'm in unfamiliar ground at this point and could use a good strategy . i notice this website do not do that but facebook do . they must be pull from a pool of cached user-feed and pluck them in client-side . not sure , again i 'm not smart enough to figure this out just yet . in other word . each city have its own feed . each user have an n-permutation of city feed combine . i would like to see possible solution to this problem use c and asp . net add to this febuary 28th , 2013 . here 's what i do base on your comment so thanks ! . for every user log in , i cache their prefer city list the top 10 post result be cache per city and store in a linq base object when a user come in and have x city as feed , i go through their city list loop then check if city posting be in cache , if not , i get from db then populate the individual post 's html into cache along with other sort element . i recombine the list of city into one feed for the user and since i have some sort element on the linq object , i can resort them in the proper order and give back to the user this do mean there be some cpu work everytime regardless as i have to combine city list into a single city list but this avoid go to the database every time and everyone benefit in fast page response time . the main drawback be since i 'm not do a single query union on city before , this require a single query per city if each be not cache but each city be check if cache or not individually so 10 query per 10 city would only happen if the site be a dead zone .",429,0.3333333333333333

15980,Questions,"Using AddEncoding x-gzip . gz without actual files
 With Apache (2. 2 and later) how can I achieve the following. I want to transparently compress using GZip encoding ( not plain Deflate) the output when a certain file is queried with its name plus the extension . gz , where the . gz version doesn't physically exist on disk. So let's say I have a file named /path/foo. bar and no file foo. bar. gz in the folder to which the URI /path maps, how can I get Apache to serve the contents of /path/foo. bar but with AddEncoding x-gzip . applied to the (non-existing) file? The rewrite part appears to be easy, but the problem is how to apply the encoding to a non-existent item. The other way around also seems to be simple as long as the client supports the encoding. Is the only solution really a script that does this on the fly? I'm aware of mod_deflate and mod_gzip and it is not what I'm looking for - at least not alone. In particular I need an actual GZIP file and not just a deflated stream. Now I was thinking of using mod_ext_filter, but couldn't bridge the gap between rewriting the name of the (non-existent) file. gz to file on one side and the LocationMatch on the other. Here's what I have. Note that the header for Content-Encoding isn't really needed by the clients in this case.

 What things should a developer designing and implementing an API for a community based website know before starting the heavy coding? There are a bunch of APIs out there like  Twitter API ,  Facebook API ,  Flickr API , etc which are all good examples. But how would you  build your own API ? What technologies would you use?

15984,Questions,"Custom Control in iPhone Interface Builder
 This appears to be a common question, but I haven't seen it answered clearly or succinctly - and as such I'm having trouble making it work. I have created a Widget. xib file in Interface Builder. It consists of: I have created Widget. h and Widget. m, which implement class Widget, which derives from UIView. In Interface Builder, Widget. xib has its File's Owner set to the Widget class. Widget. h looks like this: Widget. h includes: And its dealloc releases those four objects. In Interface Builder, the button, label, view, and imageview are all connected to the appropriate IBOutlets. Back in Interface Builder, I've opened another XIB from the project. This is Playfield. xib. It's a more traditional view, backed with PlayfieldViewController. h and . m. It contains: In Playfield. h, I've created IBOutlets for the button and the three Widgets. These are also synthesized and released in Playfield. h. In Interface Builder, Playfield. xib shows three empty rectangles where the widgets have been placed, which is what I expected. Those are wired up to their corresponding IBOutlets in Playfield. h. So, at this point I assume everything is ready to go. In Playfield. m's viewDidLoad, I do this: self. widget0. label. text = @Feed Me; In my mind, that references the widget0 IBOutlet declared in Playfield. h. That connects to the first Widget item in Playfield. xib. That, in turn, has a declared label IBOutlet in Widget. xib and Widget. h. A UILabel has a Text property. So it should change the text on the label within the widget. But it doesn't. What am I doing wrong? (I want to emphasize that I'm not looking to make an Interface Builder plugin. I know those are complicated. Within IB, I'm fine manipulating my Widgets as empty rectangles. I'll also note that I've set the background color for the widget's View, in Widget. xib, to white.

And this is my solution This is the answer provided by the book Before I get into the javascript tutorial on how to check user browser version or model, I was using the same method as the example, by acessing the length property of the links array for the loop, but after I read through the tutorial, I find out that I can also use this alternative ways, by using the method that the test condition will evalute to true only if the document. links[i return a valid value, so does my code is written using the valid method? ? If it's not, any comment regarding how to write a better code? ?

16005,Questions,"How to create relationship between two tables with revisions using Entity Framework
 So I am in the process of redesigning a small database (and potentially a much larger one) but want to show the value of using revisions / history of the business objects. I am switching the data from Access to MSSQL 2008.

16032,Questions,"My destructor is called every tick
 False alarm! (read the edit) I'm trying to make a small game, using SDL. When an entity is created, its image should up the refcount, and that's no problem.

16034,Questions,"Opening a database connection in a constructor, when should I close it? 
 well, I've been thinking of making database requests a little faster by keeping the connection to the database open as long as the object is being used.

16069,Questions,"Trying to understand the Jacobian, part I. 
 So I am trying to understand the Jacobian, as it relates to the transformation of random variables. The nuts and bolts are buried in calculus however. Now, I have been reading this  paper here, and I have some 'nested' questions so please bear with me. Question 1) (Page 1): It says that: If h is differentiable, the approximation $h(x + dx) approx h(x) + h'(x)dx$. Why is this the case? I have 'accepted' it but I would like to know why its true, although it does not affect question (2) directly for me. Question 2: (Page 2): (This is my main question): Towards the bottom, the author uses a, b, c and d as placeholders for partial derivatives. I am clear as to everything as to how he got there, up until where he puts the a, b, c and d into that mini table with the arrows. I am convinced that in the table, he has mixed up b with c. For example, he has written that: $$ (x_1 + dx_1, x_2) ightarrow (y_1 + a, y_2 + b)$$ I am conivinced that the 'b' should actually be a 'c', going by his own definition. So what I think it should read instead is: $$ (x_1 + dx_1, x_2) ightarrow (y_1 + a, y_2 + c)$$ My reasoning is as follows. For the first part, ($y_1 + a$), we can get it as so: $$ h_1(x_1 + dx_1, x_2) approx h_1(x_1, x_2) + frac{delta h_1(x_1, x_2)}{delta x_1 dx_1 + 0$$ This yields, by his own definition: $$h_1(x_1 + dx_1, x_2) approx y_1 + a$$ So far so good. So similarly, for the second coordinate of the transformed point, I reason as such: $$h_2(x_1 + dx_1, x_2) approx h_2(x_1, x_2) + frac{delta h_2(x_1, x_2)}{delta x_1 dx_1 + 0$$ So this then, by his own definitions, must be: $$h_2(x_1 + dx_1, x_2) approx y_2 + c$$ So why is it written as 'b' instead? b is as partial derivative of $h_1$ w. r. t $x_2$, whence in fact we are in actuality deriving $h_2$ w. r. t $x_1$. $x_1$ is the only thing that is varying, and the second coordinate of this point is a function of $h_2$. So what gives? Is this a typo in the paper or have I missed something completely? Some context: I currently understand the random variable $y_1$ to be created as a linear combination of the r. v's $x_1$ and $x_2$, through transformation $h_1$. Similarly, r. v $y_2$ is created as a linear combo of r. v's $x_1$ and $x_2$, through transformation $h_2$.

 I am using the below method for saving a collection of objects to the Database. The primary key for the instances is auto generated by the HibernateTemplate.

16118,Questions,"Flash right click acting differently than left click
 I've just updated to flash player 11. 2 which allows for listening to MouseEvent. RIGHT_MOUSE_UP and MouseEvent. RIGHT_MOUSE_DOWN.

16135,Questions,"When authoring a jquery plugin, how do I call one of my main plugin methods from another method? 
 I'm following the guidelines for plugin authoring on jquery's website, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to call a main plugin method from another method within the same plugin. I have a plugin like this: This is pretty much the skeleton code from jquery. However, what I'm having trouble with is figuring out the best way to create a utility function that is just for my plugin methods, or how to call one plugin method from another. For example, in my plugin, I have 3 methods, init , some_fn , and another_fn . When I call $(' el'). SomePlugin('another_fn') , within another_fn , I'd like to call some_fn . How can I do this? Calling methods. some_fn() will probably work, however, then this is dependent on the order the methods are defined within the methods object, correct? So I could call some_fn from another_fn , but not vice versa? Additionally, what's the correct way to create a utility function that all the methods in my plugin can use, so that I am not cluttering the global namespace? Do I just define the utility functions at the beginning of my plugin, right before the call to var methods?

To start off with: I have a base abstract classed, called: ItemBase then becomes my super-class to an abstract entity called Item: The idea behind this is to construct entities that will inherit from Item with additional properties set: Now, in a test method I'm trying to use reflection to invoke a method on the passed entity and return whatever data, in what ever form, back from the method. Assuming, for testing purposes we have a method in State, that returns a collection of all major cities: In my stubs I might have a test to get all cities: Then the InvokeGenericMethod(string, string, object[ args) looks something like: In theory, from the example given, the value of ret should be a type of IEnumerable, however, the returning type, if added to a watch to investivage, return List, if I check the ret value as: it ignores the check. If I change to It seems to adhere to the inheritance and allow me to cast it to IEnumberable. I'm completely stumped here. Any ideas, recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

16161,Questions,"Solve The command taskkill /F /IM MyApp. vshost. exe exited with code 128 error
 Context When debugging (with the Debug menu F5 ) a Visual Studio solution, a process called MyApp. vshost. exe is created. When you stop the debug indecently - I mean using the Stop Debug menu SHIFT + F5 and not waiting for a code line like Application. Exit() occurs - this process is not killed. Sometimes, when you later start again debugging your application, an error message occurs, saying that the file (obviously, it is the file used by the debug: binDebugMyApp. vshost. exe ) is already in use. That is why I added to the Build events this command line: taskkill /F /IM MyApp. vshost. exe Problem When the MyApp. vshost. exe process does not exist, Visual Studio is sometimes throwing an error at build time, thus preventing to build the application: The only existing solution i found is to remove the build event. Question Is there a way to resolve the error message without removing the build event?

16177,Questions,"Breaking secure pseudorandom generators by assuming BPP ! = P
 Suppose we find some problem X that is in BPP but not in P. Also, suppose we have access to a random oracle R. Do X and R allow us to break any claimed secure pseudo-random number generator? (Note that I'm unfamiliar with the literature. If this issue is already explored, I'm unlikely to know that, and links to relevant papers would be appreciated. ) I'm defining a secure pseudo-random number generator as taking some constant-sized seed and generating a bit stream which is indistinguishable from random by a BPP adversary. To show a bit-stream is pseudo-random, we just need to find an instance of X where using the bit stream as a random oracle when solving X gets the wrong answer too often. Such an instance must exist, or else X would be in P. To (probabilistically) determine that the wrong answer is being returned, we compare against using R as the entropy source. Keeping in mind that finding an appropriate instance of X might be too hard (obviously a fixed instance can't work), that assuming access to a true random oracle is a pretty strong condition, and probably other omitted details that might make things not work.

16185,Questions,"Is a direct limit of topological groups always a topological group? 
 If $(G_i, f_{ij})$ is a direct system of topological groups, is it always the case that the topologicalgroup-theoretical direct limit $G: =varinjlim_iG_i$ is a topological group? (The topology on $G$ is the final topology with respect to the canonical homomorphisms $psi_i: G_iightarrow G$). It is immediate from the group structure on $G$ and the definition of its topology that the inversion map is continuous. Moreover, I'm pretty certain that if the transition maps $f_{ij}$ are open, then the $psi_i$ are open, and this gives continuity of multiplication. It's not at all clear to me that this condition is necessary though. I have always sort of assumed that this was true, but it's never really been an issue because I never start with a system of topological groups and take the direct limit; I always have a topological group and express it as a direct limit (e. g. the idele group of a global field, or the Cartier dual of a finite free $mathbb{Z}_p$-module).","be a direct limit of topological group always a topological group ? if $ -LRB- g i , f -LCB- ij -RCB- -RRB- $ be a direct system of topological group , be it always the case that the topologicalgroup-theoretical direct limit $ g : = varinjlim ig i $ be a topological group ? -LRB- the topology on $ g $ be the final topology with respect to the canonical homomorphism $ psi i : g i ightarrow g $ -RRB- . it be immediate from the group structure on $ g $ and the definition of its topology that the inversion map be continuous . moreover , i 'm pretty certain that if the transition map $ f -LCB- ij -RCB- $ be open , then the $ psi i $ be open , and this give continuity of multiplication . it ' not at all clear to me that this condition be necessary though . i have always sort of assume that this be true , but it ' never really be an issue because i never start with a system of topological group and take the direct limit ; i always have a topological group and express it as a direct limit -LRB- e. g. the idele group of a global field , or the cartier dual of a finite free $ mathbb -LCB- z -RCB- p $ - module -RRB- .",175,0

16190,Questions,"All downloads being interrupted
 System : Windows 7 Professional 64bit. 8GB RAM, Intel i5-2400 CPU, +300GB free on the hard drive. AVG Internet Security 2012 (enabled &amp; disabled, with firewall enabled and disabled - no effect for either). This computer is less than a year old. Network : This problem is occurring on a single computer on a network with multiple computers. The router is a Motorola Netopia 3347-02 (DSL Modem/Wireless Router combined). The computer is plugged in directly to the modem, other computers are using the wireless successfully. The router has been reset. The only thing odd about the connection between the router and computer is that it is configured to allow RDP through, so it is assigned a static IP by the router and port forwarding is enabled for port 3389. Also, though I doubt it matters, a second wireless router is active behind this router providing a second network that some computers in the area use without issues. Details : All downloads initiated on this specific computer eventually fail, this includes streaming from youtube, specialized downloads (itunes), downloads from websites, FTP downloads, etc. Failure occurs with all browsers, but in chrome this is the process it takes: 1) Download begins normally, 2) At some point between (observed) 7MBs and 229MBs the download stops progressing (at this point, if watching chrome's task manager, you can see the network activity for the downloading tab drop to 0kps), 3) for some time the download sits there still attempting to complete, but will eventually display 123, 049, 871/0 B, Interrupted (where the number is whatever it actually got to). The file I am using to test this is a very large . zip file located on a server I control, but the problem seems to occur on any site. The amount downloaded is completely random, and seems to be more time-based than anything (if I start a download immediately after the last one fails, it tends to get further than the last one). Small files can get through for this reason, though they can fail as well. In a test where I simultaneously downloaded the same file via HTTP (chrome) and FTP (windows explorer), both downloads failed at the same instant, though explorer displayed Connection timed out several minutes before chrome finally showed the download as interrupted.

16195,Questions,"Type. GetInterfaces() for declared interfaces only
 First of all, there are many questions just like this, and perhaps some OPs were even asking this exact same question. The problem is that no answer to those questions (accepted or not) actually answer this question, at least none that I can find. How can I determine the interfaces a class declares directly, and not those inherited either by parents nor by the interfaces declared? e. g. Results: C declares W D declares I E declares none An acceptable solution could require the interfaces to have at least one method. If you think it truly is impossible, be careful not to make  this mistake, which actually  can be done. The InterfaceMap handles many cases, but not all (I give an example below not solvable by InterfaceMap ). One idea I had, but don't know how to implement it, is to decompile the bytecode of the class and see what is declared, as tools such as ILSpy correctly identify every case! If you like this idea, please give me a link to more info in this area. I expect some of you will advise me to clean up my design. If this is not your argument, the rest of the post is not relevant for you. Part of my project's purpose is in tracing potential code paths of given Types (at runtime). In order to determine programmatically which method will be called on a target type, without actually invoking the method nor creating an instance of the target type, knowing the declared interfaces of a target type is requisite to deterministically solve this. 'Nay' you say? Consider: The correct answer is 2 , but if you change the declaration of E to not include I directly, the answer is 1 . Now sure this is edge case, but it is the correct answer too. My engine is therefore is not fully compatible with potential user code. Telling the users to clean their code in order to use my tool is not acceptable.

16212,Questions,"How to bind a USB device with non sequential interface numbers
 I try to hook-up a USB cellular GOBI 3000 MODEM in QMI mode on a Host port. The USB host subsystem works since I already hooked-up other devices (capacitive touch screen etc). The drivers required are the usual usbnet. ko, there is also a GobiSerial. ko and a GobiNet. ko. After I boot, I see the device on my USB HUB with the proper, manufacturer, VID, PID, with 4 interfaces. When I plug the MODEM, I have the following message on the terminal: This message is generated by drivers/usb/core/config. c in function usb_parse_interface. When I list the device on the USB, I see it (no driver were binded): As we can see on the line C: , the device has 4 interfaces. Then, on lines I:  it lists the 4 interfaces as 0, 2, 3 and 8. In include/linux/usb. h it is said that The USB standard says that interfaces are supposed to be numbered from 0 to desc. bNumInterfaces-1, but a lot of devices get this wrong.  In Fact, if I connect another brand of Modem, it connects because it follows that rule. Look at that: As you can see, the 4 interfaces are numbered from 0 to 3. Now, that Modem is working on other systems in the world. What is the trick to get the drivers to bind to a device with non sequentially numbered interfaces? I'd be happy with just some clues on where to look for that answer. I did not find an answer in O'Reilly's Linux Device Drivers neither in the source code and I've been looking for more than a day.

16213,Questions,"Can power cords cause the laptop charger to spark? 
 This is a follow-up question to  my previous one : I observed that my laptop chargers spark when plugged in and the common elements seems to be power cords with on-off switches (like  this one).

16222,Questions,"Access Visual C++ DLL from Python (__thiscall calling convention)
 I want to access a class in a closed-source DLL from Python, compiled with Visual C++. I have no header files, just the object code and no interface descriptions. I can load the DLL using ctypes. CDLL , but any attempt to call a function results in an access violation. Apparently ctypes doesn't know about the __thiscall calling convention (it's not designed for C++ anyway). Usually, I'd simply write an extension module, but without source code I'm out of luck here. This is what MSDN says: The __thiscall calling convention is used on member functions and is the default calling convention used by C++ member functions that do not use variable arguments. Under __thiscall, the callee cleans the stack, which is impossible for vararg functions. Arguments are pushed on the stack from right to left, with the this pointer being passed via register ECX, and not on the stack, on the x86 architecture. For example, this is how the exported function signature looks (unmangled): public: __thiscall CFoo: : CFoo(void) My attempt to access the constructor from Python: This doesn't work because ctypes doesn't pass the instance pointer, and all I get is an access violation. I guess that I can't easily do this because ctypes has no C++ support, and as every compiler has its own name mangling conventions, it would be difficult to implement it in a generic way. The __thiscall calling convention is not implemented by ctypes. The obvious workaround would be a wrapper, written in Visual C++, which exports the function as __stdcall , but I don't want to rely on this. Correct?

16242,Questions,"Using function objects in parallel_for
 I just barely learned how to use a function in parallel. The following line of code calculates the square value of an index and places it in an array (called squares) at that index. The parallel_for function is available in Visual Studio 2010, as part of the Concurrency namespace under the header. You can see that it uses a lambda expression to calculate the squares in parallel, and this code does work and compile correctly. However, the lambda expression clutters the parallel_for function with code. I was thinking of just defining the lambda expression within a function object, for example: My question is how can I use this function (Squares) within the parallel_for function? Did I write the Squares function incorrectly, or is this just a paradigm of the parallel_for to use lambda expression?

 I have a method that given a delegate Type argument (not a generic), it returns a Delegate that it created that implements the signature.

16263,Questions,"Why are some SoundCloud tracks causing their HTML5 widget to fail? 
 I am using SoundCloud's own JavaScript API to embed HTML5 widgets on a site but am finding that often their HTML5 widget will not function correctly: neither the waveform nor the artwork displays correctly. Whether the widget functions as expected seems to be on a track-by-track basis. This is especially noticeable in the WebKit-based browsers (Chrome &amp; Safari) but I also see the issue in Firefox (all browsers used to test are their respective latest versions). Checking each browser's dev console shows that the SoundCloud code is triggering DOM INDEX_SIZE_ERR exceptions. The following JSFiddle demonstrates the problem, both using SC's own API as well as a hard-coded embed HTML copied straight from what's given on the SC track page:  The Thurston Moore track displays correctly, which suggests that this is an issue related to specific tracks.

16271,Questions,"Safe way to initialize a derived class
 I have a base class: and a derived class: This construction seems to be a bit weird but in my case this is required, because CBase does some checks and CDerived can mix some checks in between them. You can see it as a way to hook functions in the constructor. The problem with this construction is that while constructing CDerived first a CBase is constructed and there is no awareness of CDerived (so overloaded function SomeChecks() is not called). I could do something like this: This isn't really safe, because I want the constructor with the false parameter be protected, so only derived classes can call it. But then I'll have to create a second constructor (that is protected) and make it take other parameters (probably unused because is constructor is called when Init() does not have to be called). So I'm quite stuck here.

 Ok, so I'm learning about sizers in wxPython and I was wondering if it was possible to do something like: NOTE: Yeah, I literally got this from  With NOTEBOOK expanded to left and bottom, IMAGE to align to left and bottom and loginform align to right and bottom and I managed to do almost everything but now I have a problem. The problem is that I can't align Loginform and Image separately (im using Box Sizers), and I would like to. EDIT: So everyone can see what I mean: @Oh and what I was referring to, was basically that if I changed the align, it would affect both LoginForm and Image. For example if I set the align to RIGHT, both image and loginform would have been aligned to the right because of: sizer. Add(sizer4, 0, wx. ALIGN_RIGHT wx. RIGHT, 10).

16317,Questions,"XNA - How to access a texture from . x model? 
 I am just getting into XNA programming and have been unable to figure out how can I access the texture from a . x model. I am using a custom shader to display my model (just a cube with a texture mapped on it) with the filters set to point. To do this I needed to pass the effect my texture file which needed to be imported separately from my model or else it would complain since it is included in my model as well. This works perfectly how I want it, however this isn't really an agreeable method when I have many different models with their own textures. My question is: How am I able to access the texture included in my model directly from it and send that to my shader? Or am I able to access it directly with HLSL? What I have tried: I have found posts saying that it can assigned to a texture variable with: Texture2d texture = ((BasicEffect)model. Meshes[0]. Effects[0]). Texture When I tried this the game runs but the cubes are just black. I can see that the texture variable is holding info and has the right dimensions but I can't tell if it is correctly holding the actual image. When I used just the BasicEffect they rendered just fine with their texture. Update: I have managed to get this to work after a little bit of fiddling. My game loads in a few hundred of the same cube and upon creation of each it would try save the texture of the model using the code above and then go through the mesh parts and change the effects to my custom effect. I discovered that the first cube created would save the texture okay but any subsequent cubes created would complain that they can't be cast as a BasicEffect. This resulted in one textured cube and then a lot of black ones. I am guessing that when it reuses the same model over and over like that it will just use the one that was modified to use my custom effect which was done on the first instance of the cube. Is this normal?

16318,Questions,"Simulating user input for TDD JavaScript
 I'm finding it increasingly difficult to simulate actual user events using jQuery or native element trigger functions. For example, if you have a text input and you don't want the user to be able to add a character, you can call e. preventDefault() with the jQuery-normalised event object on the keydown event. However, there is no way to programatically verify this test scenario. The following test passes even without the call to preventDefault because the jQuery keydown trigger isn't a real event.

16327,Questions,"latency measurement on Linux-based router using tcpdump
 I am using tcpdump to measure latency on a linux router, i. e. the delay experienced by packets as they pass through the router (made of Ubuntu 10). For this purpose, I captured packets in the IN and Out interfaces and subtracted their log timestamp to know the latency inside the router.

16341,Questions,"using java mail message object between web applications
 I'm developing a web application which acts as an email client for mobile. In this application user can login and provide numerous email ids for monitoring. There are two main classes in the web application. 1. MailGetter 2. MailFormatter Behaviour of MailGetter class: Timertask initiated which will execute for every 10 minutes Obtains the numerous email ids from database which are provided for monitoring establishes connection with mail server for the first email id and obtains recently arrived email message object passes the message object to MailFormatter class Behavior of MailFormatter class: parses the email message object various recursive calls made if the message has many multiparts inorder to parse parts one by one downloads also attachments along with this message returns an xml string to the MailGetter class which will be stored as simple text file with the following content: Example: MobileResponderServlet: A separate servlet is also coded in the web application which will read the simple xml text file and send the read content to mobile The main demerit of this application might be MailGetter class will be waiting until all the functions (including recursive calls) of MailFormatter class finishes execution. Once the control is returned from MailFormatter class to MailGetter class, it will obtain the next message object from mail server and passes it to MailFormatter class. So intimating about new emails to the mobile user consumes time. Even when MailFormatter class is implemented as a separate thread, consider in a case if there are 1000 new emails in a single inbox (for a single emailid) which will be invocating 1000 MailFormatter threads, which will make the process more resource intensive. So I'm deciding to unplug MailFormatter from MailGetter. MailGetter will be running as a separate web application in one server whereas MailFormatter will be running as a separate web application in another server. After obtaining the recent email message object MailGetter web application persists (via message. writeTo(FileOutputstream)) the message object in a location which is also common to MailFormatter. MailFormatter class then reads (via MimeMessage(Session, InputStream) constructor) and parses the message object one by one and then stores the XML Content in another location which will be read by MobileResponderServlet and sent to mobile. Will this process be efficient in real time? Will this be arising problems especially while sharing message objects between MailGetter and MailFormatter web applications? Please do let me know if there are any other ways. This web application will be handling more than 5000 users (minimum) who have provided numerous email ids for monitoring.","use java mail message object between web application i 'm develop a web application which act as an email client for mobile . in this application user can login and provide numerous email id for monitoring . there be two main class in the web application . 1 . mailgetter 2 . mailformatter behavior of mailgetter class : timertask initiate which will execute for every 10 minute obtain the numerous email id from database which be provide for monitor establish connection with mail server for the first email id and obtain recently arrive email message object pass the message object to mailformatter class behavior of mailformatter class : parse the email message object various recursive call make if the message have many multipart inorder to parse part one by one download also attachment along with this message return an xml string to the mailgetter class which will be store as simple text file with the follow content : example : mobileresponderservlet : a separate servlet be also cod in the web application which will read the simple xml text file and send the read content to mobile the main demerit of this application might be mailgett class will be wait until all the function -LRB- include recursive call -RRB- of mailformatter class finish execution . once the control be return from mailformatter class to mailgetter class , it will obtain the next message object from mail server and pass it to mailformatter class . so intimate about new email to the mobile user consume time . even when mailformatter class be implement as a separate thread , consider in a case if there be 1000 new email in a single inbox -LRB- for a single emailid -RRB- which will be invocat 1000 mailformatter thread , which will make the process more resource intensive . so i 'm decide to unplug mailformatter from mailgetter . mailgetter will be run as a separate web application in one server whereas mailformatter will be run as a separate web application in another server . after obtain the recent email message object mailgetter web application persist -LRB- via message . writeto -LRB- fileoutputstream -RRB- -RRB- the message object in a location which be also common to mailformatter . mailformatter class then read -LRB- via mimemessage -LRB- session , inputstream -RRB- constructor -RRB- and parse the message object one by one and then store the xml content in another location which will be read by mobileresponderservlet and send to mobile . will this process be efficient in real time ? will this be arise problem especially while share message object between mailgetter and mailformatter web application ? please do let me know if there be any other way . this web application will be handle more than 5000 user -LRB- minimum -RRB- who have provide numerous email id for monitoring .",430,0

16355,Questions,"Web-service with attachment failed on 2-ways SSL connection
 I have two applications, one that provides a Web-service (let's call it ws-provider ), the other one that is the client of this Web-Service (call it ws-client ). This communication is protected through a 2-ways SSL. Both servers have been correctly configured regarding this confidentiality restrictions (certificates installation, SSL configuration, Tomcat parametrization. ) The servers are running on Tomcat (5. 5 for ws-provider , 6 for ws-client ), Java 6 and uses Jax-WS for providing/consuming the web-service. When the user connects to the ws-client application and executes the action that calls the ws-provider web-service, the latter action generally fails with the following error: On the ws-provider , I get this error: Now, the strange part is that I just said that it generally failed when calling the web-service. For some reasons, sometimes I get a successfull attempt when calling the web-service. This generally happens if the user launches the action in the minute that follows his login to the application (No, I don't know why! ). The web-service request contains an attachment. This attachment is a PDF file that is not bigger than 15Kb (at least during all my tests, successfull or failed, this size was never exceeded). So after many tests, I tried to call the same web-service without attaching any PDF file, and the call was successfull. For your information, if the security constraints are disabled on the ws-provider (i. e. we do not use 2-ways SSL connexion anymore) then the web-service calls never fail. So I imagine that I have to configure something on my web-services or on Tomcat (or ? ) to make the system working. Any idea? Java code Here is the Java interface that provides the method call on ws-client (as you can see, the core Java classes used for the WS are generated by Jax-WS library): The call on ws-client is as follow ( xmlFile contains the XML for the request, datahandler is a javax. activation. DataHandler that contains the PDF attachment): There are lots of configuration files, logs or Java classes. So do not hesitate to ask for more details if needed! EDIT 1 I've tried to force the integration of the PDF file within the SOAP message, by defining the  wp279634 MTOM threshold to 2Mb: On ws-client : On ws-provider , I configured the MTOM annotation with MTOM(threshold=2097152) This correction did not solve my issue, unfortunately.

16364,Questions,"Entity Framework POCO with WCF software design question
 I am going to use Entity Framework and WCF in my application. The suggested practice, as I saw, is using POCO with Entity Framework and also using POCO classes as DataContracts. That is actually what POCO and Attributes are used for, -if I am not wrong. However I am asked to use seperate classses for Entity Framework POCO's and WCF DataContracts. And to use a mapper between POCO's and DataContracts. Like, Foo and FooContract with same properties. I am on the first approachs side but I wonder if the second approach (seperate classes approach) provides flexibility to the application or is it just a waste of effort.

16396,Questions,"Quotient metric spaces: pseudo metrics versus metrics
 I got the following definition from wikipedia: If $M$ is a metric space with metric $d$, and $sim$ is an equivalence relation on $M$, then we can endow the quotient set $M/{sim}$ with the following (pseudo)metric. Given two equivalence classes $[x]$ and $[y]$, we define $$ d'([x], [y]) = inf{d(p_1, q_1)+d(p_2, q_2)+dotsb+d(p_{n}, q_{n}) $$ where the infimum is taken over all finite sequences $(p_1, p_2, dots, p_n)$ and $(q_1, q_2, dots, q_n)$ with $[p_1]=[x], [q_n]=[y], [q_i]=[p_{i+1}], i=1, 2, dots, n-1$.

16414,Questions,"Render target for each scene, for transitions
 I'm trying to come up with a general concept for transitions, without having to include any specific code inside the actual scene. In all the samples I've seen so far the scenes handle that stuff themselves. Like a fade in/out, where the scenes have to adjust their draw method, for the correct transparency. But not only would this be annoying to have in every scene, with multiple kinds of transitions you'd get cluttered code pretty fast. So I've been thinking. The only way I could come up with to support this, and more complicated transitions, without handling it in the scene itself, are render targets for each scene. The render target would be set from the scene manager before calling the draw method. After draw the render target would get reset to the render target of the manager, and the scene's texture would get drawn with information about the current transition. Without clearing the manager texture more scenes would follow, if more have to be drawn. This way you could do pretty much anything (transition wise), the scenes would be completely independent of each other, and you wouldn't need a single line of transition code in the actual scenes. (For reference, there are various transition types I'd like to be able to do. Not only fades, but also shader effects, moving one scene in while the current one is pushed away, etc. , involving one or multiple scenes. ) Well, that's my theory. Here comes my question: Does this sound like a viable plan? Is this the way to go? I've read about performance problems when switching rendering targets too frequently, and other problems, which is the main reason I'm hesitating to implement this. But so far I couldn't think of or find a better method. Although I think it shouldn't make a difference, for the moment I only care about 2D (mentioned just in case).","render target for each scene , for transition i 'm try to come up with a general concept for transition , without have to include any specific code inside the actual scene . in all the sample i 've see so far the scene handle that stuff themselves . like a fade in/out , where the scene have to adjust their draw method , for the correct transparency . but not only would this be annoy to have in every scene , with multiple kind of transition you 'd get clutter code pretty fast . so i 've be think . the only way i could come up with to support this , and more complicated transition , without handle it in the scene itself , be rend target for each scene . the render target would be set from the scene manager before call the draw method . after draw the render target would get reset to the render target of the manager , and the scene 's texture would get draw with information about the current transition . without clear the manager texture more scene would follow , if more have to be draw . this way you could do pretty much anything -LRB- transition wise -RRB- , the scene would be completely independent of each other , and you would n't need a single line of transition code in the actual scene . -LRB- for reference , there be various transition type i 'd like to be able to do . not only fade , but also shad effect , move one scene in while the current one be push away , etc. , involve one or multiple scene . -RRB- well , that ' my theory . here come my question : do this sound like a viable plan ? be this the way to go ? i 've read about performance problem when switch render target too frequently , and other problem , which be the main reason i 'm hesitate to implement this . but so far i could n't think of or find a better method . although i think it should n't make a difference , for the moment i only care about 2d -LRB- mention just in case -RRB- .",323,0.5

16437,Questions,"Power surge protection on office LAN, medium-small scale
 I've got an office LAN setup with about 15 computers, which is due to expand to 30 before long. Each computer is on its own voltage stabilizer and UPS. I live in a place with horrible, substandard, screamingly bad electricity. The voltage coming down the wires can dip as much as 30% below the advertised 220V, causing all of the voltage stabilizers to cycle hard, and sometimes (up to 5 times daily) the whole system shorts out and has to be reset at the source. Obviously, I'm starting to lose components here and there, which, given the current trend, will be quite costly soon. I'd like to put in a medium-scale upstream solution that levels the curve before it hits my poor stabilizers and power supplies but I'm not sure where to start. Could someone elaborate on what could be the cause of these surges (are they surges? ), and a medium scale solution? To put it another way, someone in another post said Bottom line - I think you need something to smooth your electricity.  What is that something?

16443,Questions,"How to determine when a user is leaving a webpage (excluding certain links)
 The situation: I have a Grails webpage with two tables. One table displays a persons information (including certain flags), and the second table has a list of flags with an add button that allows the user to add a given flag to themselves. Now, there is a save button that, when clicked, pushes the current state of the users flags to our database. So I want to be able to display a prompt if there is unsaved information being displayed when a user tries to navigate to another part of the site. This is easy enough by using an existing isDirty boolean that each flag stores. I can just loop through the persons active flags and check if it is dirty or not. If the person contains at least 1 dirty flag, I need to display a prompt if they try to leave, because that data won't be saved unless they explicitly hit the button. The problem: There are many ways to navigate away from this page. I am using &lt; body onbeforeunload=@checkForDirtyFlags(); @&gt; , where checkForDirtyFlags() is a basic js function to check for any dirty flags. But here's the thing - when a user adds or removes a flag, that causes a page reload because the way the page is setup is to redirect to a url like this: The controller then knows to add the flag with id 123456 to the current person. This does NOT change where the person is in the website however, because the same page is still rendered (it just contains updated tables). So basically, when I see a URL with addFlag or removeFlag, I do not want to prompt the user if they are sure they want to navigate away from the page, because in the eyes of the user they are not leaving the page. The question: Is there any way to determine what the target is during an onbeforeunload ? So that I can have something like this in my javascript: If any of this isn't clear, please let me know and I'll try and clear it up.

Another service class say ChildService extends the BaseService class. One of the methods in the ChildService calls a private method defined in the BaseService.

16491,Questions,"Opinion on combined strong/weak smart pointer
 I would like to get some constructive input on smart pointers. The C++11 standard defines unique_ptr and weak_ptr such that you can model data dependencies as DAGs with weak edges that do not cause dependency cycles. Thus, the distinction between strong and weak pointers is modelled on the type level. What about a smart pointer that decides ownership at runtime through a state flag. We have a smart pointer in our library that does so and has the main advantage that you can point to objects either on the heap or on the stack. What other advantages and disadvantages do you see? I have not been able to find such a smart pointer in any library so far, so: Are we the first to see the need for this feature or is it a dumb/dangerous idea? Thanks for all your input! Edit Apparently, I have not made myself clear enough. There can be only one master and an arbitrary number of slaves. In this way, the scheme I propose differs from weak/strong pointers since it is much simpler. The my_ptr class only stores a pointer and the state:","opinion on combine strong/weak smart pointer i would like to get some constructive input on smart pointer . the c + +11 standard define unique ptr and weak ptr such that you can model data dependency as dag with weak edge that do not cause dependency cycle . thus , the distinction between strong and weak pointer be model on the type level . what about a smart pointer that decide ownership at runtime through a state flag . we have a smart pointer in our library that do so and have the main advantage that you can point to object either on the heap or on the stack . what other advantage and disadvantage do you see ? i have not be able to find such a smart pointer in any library so far , so : be we the first to see the need for this feature or be it a dumb/dangerous idea ? thanks for all your input ! edit apparently , i have not make myself clear enough . there can be only one master and an arbitrary number of slave . in this way , the scheme i propose differ from weak/strong pointer since it be much simple . the my ptr class only store a pointer and the state :",194,0.5

16513,Questions,"Help with an np-completeness proof
 I know that graph contractability is NP-complete: given $G=(V_1, E_1)$ and $H=(V_2, E_2)$, can a graph isomorphic to $H$ be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of edge contractions? Consider the following variant of the contractibility problem. Each node in the input graph is labeled with a unique bit-string of arbitrary length. The similarity of two nodes is defined to be the length of the longest common prefix of their labels; the weight of an edge is the similarity between its endpoints. At each step, we are allowed contract any maximum -weight edge $(u, v)$ and label the new node with the longest common prefix of the labels of $u$ and $v$. (There may be several maximum-weight edges. ) However, we must also preserve label uniqueness; if some other node already has the new label, we cannot contract the edge $(u, v)$.

16539,Questions,"ASP. NET MVC - How should sending email be handled? 
 In an ASP. NET MVC application, how should the sending of emails be handled? I've been thinking about this, and I really like the idea of handling it in an MVC-oriented way (it is an MVC application, after all. ) What I mean is that the email that gets delivered to the user is really just a view that should have a model passed to it. This raises some questions: How should we deliver views to both the requesting browser and an SMTP server at the same time, when an action is executed? Does the framework have any facilities to support this? If not, is there some 3rd party release/guidance for this sort of functionality?

16558,Questions,"Large amount of unit tests cause freezes with Failed Binder Transaction
 I have about 400 unit tests that I have written for my Android application. If I run the tests package by package, everything works fine and all my tests pass. However, if I try to run them all at once, eventually (about 360 tests in), Android starts spitting out ! ! ! Failed Binder Transaction Errors ! ! ! . After about 10-20 of these errors, the process for the application I am testing gets killed and the unit tests never even complete. I should note that during this time Eclipse reports Collecting test information in the Console. I think that is odd because it shows that it is running tests even though the JUnit UI doesn't reflect that. When everything works properly, during the Collecting test information phase I see the tests run, the JUnit UI then comes up, and then all the tests are run again (I know this by reading logcat).

16639,Questions,"Enable/Disable HTML Element (IFrame) to Prevent or Allow Tabbing to it / Focusing it
 Is there an easy way to enable or disable an IFrame to take it out of the Tab order? I’ve created a simple HTML page that has several links that when clicked show or hide an IFrame associated with the link and set the SRC property of the IFrame to one of my Wordpress blogs’ PressThis forms. This way I can easily add a post to any of the blogs from a single page. Everything on this page works nicely as expected except for the behavior of the Tab key. All of the IFrames are initially hidden and have no SRC set (eg &lt; iframe src=@@&gt; &lt; /iframe&gt; ). The problem is that when I press Tab, instead of going from link to link, it sets focus to the hidden (and empty) IFrames between links. When the frame is shown and loaded with the PressThis form, pressing Tab correctly navigates through the input fields of the form (and everything else in the page) between links. However when the frame is then hidden again, pressing Tab still goes through each field, so getting from link to link with the keyboard is pretty bad. I’m trying to figure out a way to toggle the IFrame so that when it is hidden, pressing Tab skips over it (it is removed from the Tab order), and when it is shown, pressing Tab navigates between its form fields. I looked around and cannot find anything about disabling HTML elements directly (HTML elements don’t seem to have a disabled property as part of the DOM, nor is there a disabled CSS style).

16653,Questions,"Why closing dictionary in PostScript? 
 PostScript books always suggest to carefully handle dictionaries. Separate user dictionaries and keep them small, close dictionary when it is no longer needed, avoid overloading global dictionary, etc. However, I think, these instructions back to old ages where there were severe hardware limitation for memory. Closing a dictionary to free memory. The memory a PS script needs were probably comparable with the machine available memory. In modern time, the memory needed for a heavy PostScript task (e. g. long document or complicated drawing) is much lesser than the machine memory, and closing a dictionary with hundreds or even thousands of elements should have no significant effect on the machine performance. Correct me if I'm wrong! Consider that we put everything in one dictionary or global dictionary; does it have a negative impact on the PostScript performance?

16661,Questions,"Getting HttpContext from BackgroundWorker process
 I have an ASP. NET site and I've been doing some work refactoring code to try to remove some long running processes (in the order of an hour) from the actual http Request by creating a BackgroundWorker and sending the work off to that to process. This was running fine on cutdown tests but when I applied the logic to the real code I found problems accessing Session variables from the code running in the Background Worker. It seems that the HttpContext object that was passed has a null session and if I ask for HttpContext. Current I get null back. I'm assuming that this is because they are in a different thread and that the session and HttpContext. Current are both reliant on being in the same thread. Is there any way I can get access to the Session from the background worker or am I stuck with finding all the variables I need from session and putting them in an usable data structure and then putting them back in session (if appropriate) afterwards?

16674,Questions,"Do any C++11 thread-safety guarantees apply to third-party thread libraries compiled/linked with C++11? 
 C++11 offers features like  thread-safe initialization of static variables , and citing that question we'll say for instance: So ostensibly (? ) this is true regardless of whether a module compiled with a C++11 compiler included the thread headers, or spawned any threads in its body. You're offered the guarantee even if it were linked against another module that used C++11 threads and called the function. But what if your other module that calls into this code wasn't using C++11 threads, but something like Qt's QThread . Is atomic initialization of statics then outside of the scope of C++11's ability to make such a guarantee?

16717,Questions,"Amplitude and bigness issues
 There are a couple of statements that I have read which are made as though they were trivial, but I am doubtful about them. One is related to an example showing that the s-invariant of an ample line bundle on a projective variety X is an algebraic integer of degree $leq dim X$. Recall that, given an ideal sheaf $mathcal{I}subset mathcal{O}_X$ on a projective irreducible variety X, the s-invariant of $mathcal{I}$ with respect to an ample line bundle L is $s_L(mathcal{I})$ is the minimum $sin mathbb{R}$ such that $mu^{ast}(sL)-E$ is nef on $X'$, where $$mu: X'=Bl_{mathcal{I}}Xightarrow X$$ is the blow-up along the ideal $mathcal{I}$, with exceptional divisor E. The author claims that the class $s_L(mathcal{I})L-E$ is nef (by definition) but not ample and then uses the Campana-Peternell theorem to conclude the result. How does the non-ampleness follow? Now let L be a big and nef divisor on a smooth projective variety X of dimension n and assume that the Seshadri constant of L at some point $xin X$ is $epsilon(L; x)&gt; 2n$ (we hence have the same inequality at a very general point).

16767,Questions,"IndexOutOfBoundsException thrown by java. nio bytebuffer. put(byte[ arsrc, int offset , int length)
 Hello all I hope someone can help me resolve this issue. I'm curious as to why I'm getting this runtime error when from my perspective I shouldn't here's the code section: This is what's displayed when I run the program: here's integer variable MGBUFLN declared prior to any reference to it within LU62XnsCvr Class here's the byte array that's used as the source declared as a LU62XnsCvr Class member variable. This I copied from the Oracle Java Doc website; don't know exactly how current it is, but it's marked as java 6 and I'm running IBM's SDK which is using java 1. 6 public ByteBuffer put(byte[ src, int offset, int length) Relative bulk put method (optional operation). This method transfers bytes into this buffer from the given source array. If there are more bytes to be copied from the array than remain in this buffer, that is, if length remaining(), then no bytes are transferred and a BufferOverflowException is thrown. Otherwise, this method copies length bytes from the given array into this buffer, starting at the given offset in the array and at the current position of this buffer. The position of this buffer is then incremented by length. In other words, an invocation of this method of the form dst. put(src, off, len) has exactly the same effect as the loop except that it first checks that there is sufficient space in this buffer and it is potentially much more efficient. Parameters: src - The array from which bytes are to be read offset - The offset within the array of the first byte to be read; must be non-negative and no larger than array. length length - The number of bytes to be read from the given array; must be non-negative and no larger than array. length - offset Returns: This buffer Throws: BufferOverflowException - If there is insufficient space in this buffer IndexOutOfBoundsException - If the preconditions on the offset and length parameters do not hold ReadOnlyBufferException - If this buffer is read-only I'm a little concerned with the statements: Otherwise, this method copies length bytes from the given array into this buffer, starting at the given offset in the array and at the current position of this buffer.

16779,Questions,"Why can I not call these JQuery/Javascript Functions in an external script file? 
 I am writing a lot of JQuery code in a page and have decided to move some of the functions out to a separate file. So, file 1 has nothing but function definitions: In the main page, I have placed my JQuery at the end of the file - following the optimization techniques found in Zakas' book High Performance Javascript. So, at the very end of the file (but before the closing body tag) I have: Note that the final Javascript scripts are loaded - and run - after the page is loaded and the DOM declared. However, I get an error every time that says 'doSomething' is undefined. This works without problem if the functions are included in the main script. It is only when I pull them outside that I get this error. Now, my guess is that the first file hasn't being fully loaded/compiled when the second one makes its calls. But it seems to me that the last script (essentially acting in the Ready role) should be the one compiled last. When I look at JQuery and other JS files, they start with anonymous functions rather than just launching right in to function definitions so clearly there is something else going on. Note that I don't think it is a problem loading/finding the file: I've tried various paths to ensure that the path is correct and that hasn't fixed the issue. Does anyone have a clue why my functions aren't being found? Update: If I take the file contents exactly as they are found and put it into the first script tag rather than loading it from the file, this works fine. But I have checked the script file name repeatedly and it is correct. So it is something about the process of loading it from an external file. UPDATE: Solved. I ran it through FireBug as keegan and dskrepps suggested and it jumped right out at me. I had an ASP. NET variable that I was placing in the scripts but, of course, ASP. NET isn't parsing the file or replacing variables. When Javascript saw these replaceable values, it was dying on a parse error that wasn't reported. So - the file was NOT being loaded and it isn't a Javascript function call issue at all.

16795,Questions,"How fast is SQLite via Python
 I was just curious if anyone could tell me if using SQLite to store a dictionary (as in brute force) for use in a Python script was an efficient method. While I am relatively new to Python I do have quite a bit of experience with other programming languages and am currently working on a pentesting tool to use in Backtrack. So far I am quite impressed with the speed and simplicity of Python, and my SQL queries seem to be working pretty ideally to return the needed prefixes for my brute force tool. However, I guess what I'm wondering is what is the standard for storing large data files in Python? Am I overlooking a better (faster) way of storing my prefixes simply because of my comfort with SQL? Please bear in mind that I am not using Python to query IDs 0 through n and use them, rather I am using Python to narrow down the possibilities and query those dictionary entries that match the criteria.

With this ItemRenderer, it's possible that the contents could exceed the width and height of the DataGrid cell - and when this happens, scroll bars appear, letting me scroll the individual cell. What I would like, however, is that when the contents of the cell are too large, the entire DataGrid scrolls, rather than the individual cells. Now, when I set the custom ItemRenderer's horizontal and vertical scroll bar policies to off, I get the vertical scrolling on the DataGrid that I want (the individual cells stretch to accommodate the full height of the contents) but I don't get any horizontal scrolling. Instead, any content too wide for the cell is clipped. Incidentally, setting the DataGrid's horizontal scroll bar policy to on has no effect, the scroll bar gutter is drawn, but nothing scrolls Is there a way to force the DataGrid to scroll horizontally when my custom ItemRenderer's contents are too wide for the cell?","be it possible to get a custom itemrenderer to scroll the datagrid rather than its cell ? i 'm have an issue with a custom itemrenderer i 've write for a datagrid . with this itemrenderer , it ' possible that the content could exceed the width and height of the datagrid cell - and when this happen , scroll bar appear , let me scroll the individual cell . what i would like , however , be that when the content of the cell be too large , the entire datagrid scroll , rather than the individual cell . now , when i set the custom itemrenderer 's horizontal and vertical scroll bar policy to off , i get the vertical scrolling on the datagrid that i want -LRB- the individual cell stretch to accommodate the full height of the content -RRB- but i do n't get any horizontal scrolling . instead , any content too wide for the cell be clip . incidentally , set the datagrid 's horizontal scroll bar policy to on have no effect , the scroll bar gutter be draw , but nothing scroll be there a way to force the datagrid to scroll horizontally when my custom itemrenderer 's content be too wide for the cell ?",186,0

16825,Questions,"Request-scoped property in controllers
 I'm relative new to Spring so there is a thing not very obvious for me. Namely, the fact that controllers are singletons. I agree that this is a good approach but this doesn't let me implement a thing that I used to implement with other frameworks. I build a web application which throughout uses AJAX requests. I have controllers hierarchy with BaseController as parent and all other controllers extend it. Controller actions which should return response to the client are annotated with the ResponseBody annotation and return serialized JSON string to the client. Method createJSONResponse() which performs this serialization is implemented in the BaseController and the main idea here is that each of the child controllers' actions populates a map Map&lt; String, Object&gt; responseMap with the required for client data and then this map is accessed in the BaseController and serialized. I don't want to create new instance of responseMap in every action and I don't want to pass it every time as a parameter for createJSONResponse() . I achieved this with other framework by declaring responseMap in BaseController as protected property. I can't do this with Spring since all controllers are singletons and I will not have new instance of responseMap with every request. I'm not sure making BaseController request scoped is a good idea. I created a helper class as request scoped bean and declared responseMap in this helper. Then I injected this bean as Autowired in BaseController . I also moved out createJSONResponse() method in this helper. Then from controllers I populate this map as helper. responseMap. add(&lt; somedata&gt; ) and call helper. createResponseMap() . In this case responseMap becomes empty in createResponseMap() , it does not contain data populated in controller action. It somehow goes out that responseMAp is not thread-safe and it is moving from thread to thread with each async request. Are there any ways to achieve functionality I need? SOLVED BY A WORKAROUND: Solved the problem by instantiating responseMap before every request and adding to the HttpServletRequest object in request interceptor. Then createJSONResponse() method and responseMap population methods refer to the getRequestMap() method which gets responseMap from the HttpServletRequest. P. S. Still will be glad to know the better solution.","request-scoped property in controller i 'm relative new to spring so there be a thing not very obvious for me . namely , the fact that controller be singleton . i agree that this be a good approach but this do n't let me implement a thing that i use to implement with other framework . i build a web application which throughout us ajax request . i have controller hierarchy with basecontroller as parent and all other controller extend it . controller action which should return response to the client be annotate with the responsebody annotation and return serialized json string to the client . method createjsonresponse -LRB- -RRB- which perform this serialization be implement in the basecontroller and the main idea here be that each of the child controller ' action populate a map map &lt; string , object &gt; responsemap with the require for client data and then this map be access in the basecontroller and serialize . i do n't want to create new instance of responsemap in every action and i do n't want to pass it every time as a parameter for createjsonresponse -LRB- -RRB- . i achieve this with other framework by declare responsemap in basecontroller as protected property . i ca n't do this with spring since all controller be singleton and i will not have new instance of responsemap with every request . i 'm not sure make basecontroller request scop be a good idea . i create a help class as request scop bean and declare responsemap in this helper . then i inject this bean as autowir in basecontroller . i also move out createjsonresponse -LRB- -RRB- method in this helper . then from controller i populate this map as helper . responsemap . add -LRB- &lt; somedata &gt; -RRB- and call helper . createresponsemap -LRB- -RRB- . in this case responsemap become empty in createresponsemap -LRB- -RRB- , it do not contain data populate in controller action . it somehow go out that responsemap be not thread-safe and it be move from thread to thread with each async request . be there any way to achieve functionality i need ? solve by a workaround : solve the problem by instantiate responsemap before every request and add to the httpservletrequ object in request interceptor . then createjsonresponse -LRB- -RRB- method and responsemap population method refer to the getrequestmap -LRB- -RRB- method which get responsemap from the httpservletrequest . p. s. still will be glad to know the better solution .",371,0.75

 I'm making a program that allows users to customize hotkeys and make them perform specific functions. The first function that I have made moves the cursor to a specific set of coordinates within the game window.

However, it appears that each time SetCursorPos is called, it moves twice: first to the correct spot, the to (0, 0). I'm not sure what's causing this, and I've spent hours googling and debugging to no avail. Everything works correctly except that it moves twice. I'm using Windows 8 and compiling with Code: : Blocks. The script outputs what coordinates it should be moving too before the mouse moves and after. They should be the same.

 I need to calculate the distance between GPS co-ordinates to calculate distance traveled. I've tried both the Haversine and Vincenty algorithms, which work fine on my desktop PC, but when I port the code to the dsPIC, they return 0 for points that are close (within several meters) due to a lack of floating point precision and poor implementations of sin and cos.

16851,Questions,"Apache Shiro integration and Netty ExecutionHandler/OrderedMemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor
 I just added an ExecutionHandler to my server pipeline just before my main business logic handler as recommended in the documentation. I am using Apache Shiro  for security. It worked fine until I added the ExecutionHandler . The issue : Shiro's execution context is bound to the current thread in which you obtain the Subject object. So, if the Subject is obtained in the worker thread, but the business logic executes in a separate ExecutionHandler managed thread then the two execution contexts won't be connected as far as Shiro is concerned. Thus Shiro in the ExecutionHandler thread will fail to be aware that the Subject is in fact authenticated. So I'm getting Authentication errors. It is possible to associate a given Subject with a Runnable before passing it to Executor. execute() so that the security context is maintained.

So, how should I approach this? The first category is unproblematic. For the second one I would like to indicate a place, while clearly alerting the user that it is no more than an educated guess. For the third, we can to no better than placing a list of towns (etc. ) inside a region. Can this be captured in a useful way in KML? Multiple Names.

16893,Questions,"Objective-C should I be using NSError and why presentError function not working
 I am creating an application on iPhone where I am taking code written and Java and translating into Objective-C, as the app must work similarly in both Android and iPhone. Now problems of course are there are certain areas where the languages differ quite a bit, and can be difficult to implement just right. One of the areas where it is of course different is you cannot create NSMutableArrays or NSMutableDictionaries which only accepts objects of a certain type. So when I am creating the getters and setters for these objects, I have been doing this, example below: Now originally I was using NSRaise Exception, but after doing reading up on it, it recommends against this as exception handling is resource intensive and should not be used for this type of situation. So NSError I read was a good solution, so I was reading up on this guide  My question is two fold, if I decide to use NSError should, is it best practice to declare the NSError object in the method, i. e like this Or is it okay just to declare the error within the else statement above, like this Secondly, in the guide I linked above, in the conclusion the author says In this example, I am checking to see if the error is still nil after my message call. If it is no longer nil I know that an error occurred and that I need to display it to the user. Apple provides a built in method to do this with a call to presentError: on the NSApplication instance and he uses this line of code here This does not work for me, I do not get an autocomplete option with this code, just says use of undeclared identifier. Am I missing something obvious here? Also, just to be sure, is the method I am using, the best method to go about ensuring the user sends in an array with the correct object types? Or is there another method which could be used which would achieve the same thing but in a more efficient manner. Thanks in advance! ! EDIT: Additional question, would it be such a bad idea to use NSException, as the problem with NSError is the app carries on, I am considering having it so if they do pass in an array with an invalid object, that it does just cause the application to crash and raise an exception.

16897,Questions,"Turning Chinese line breaks on and off
 I am typesetting a document in Chinese with spaces between words, for the purpose of making it easier for learners. Because of this, I am typesetting most of my document with no line-breaks between words. Because Chinese words are generally pretty short, this will generally not cause any big problems. However, in some parts of my document, I will need to use Chinese line breaks, as defined by XeTeXlinebreaklocale zh (or similar) to avoid over-filled boxes. Basically, those are regular paragraphs of Chinese text, which will not break at all without this option turned on.

16898,Questions,"Java Spring/Struts2 Web Project - Working on JSP without build deploy but still in git repo. Possible? 
 I can't seem to find an answer to this. Heavy web stack - spring, struts2, hibernate. Every project I work on I'm faced with a conflict between front end and backend Dev. The project will rely upon the app being built and deployed for it to start (ie spring application-context. xml will fail without classes) so we can't just deploy the git repo. Yet front end development will want the changes to be visible without waiting for a full build deploy. They can work on the live project and then reintegrate changed files back into the source repo but this exposes the project to risks such as lost work or incomplete/incorrect checkin due to added complexity. Is there some magic bullet that will let ID work on a project with their preferred plain text editor where they won't need to wait for build cycles to preview changes? there must be something better than these options? Eclipse maven 'run on server' can still take 30 or 60 seconds to get a preview up (drives me crazy as a backend dev). Frameworks like play are not an option. I'm just thinking now maybe having a static web module that builds with a dynamic web module may be the answer? Ie have maven pick files up from both? So then the frontend guys can just deploy the static content and work on it.","java spring/struts2 web project - work on jsp without build deploy but still in git repo . possible ? i ca n't seem to find an answer to this . heavy web stack - spring , struts2 , hibernate . every project i work on i 'm face with a conflict between front end and backend dev . the project will rely upon the app be build and deploy for it to start -LRB- ie spring application-context . xml will fail without class -RRB- so we ca n't just deploy the git repo . yet front end development will want the change to be visible without wait for a full build deploy . they can work on the live project and then reintegrate change file back into the source repo but this expose the project to risk such as lose work or incomplete/incorrect checkin due to add complexity . be there some magic bullet that will let id work on a project with their preferred plain text editor where they wo n't need to wait for build cycle to preview change ? there must be something better than these option ? eclipse maven ` run on server ' can still take 30 or 60 second to get a preview up -LRB- drive me crazy as a backend dev -RRB- . framework like play be not an option . i 'm just think now maybe have a static web module that build with a dynamic web module may be the answer ? ie have maven pick file up from both ? so then the frontend guy can just deploy the static content and work on it .",248,0.8

16910,Questions,"Security issues regarding links in PHPBB2
 I've recently edited some regexps on a phpbb2's bbcode. php and I'm wondering if it'd bring security issues (regarding script injection from href, mainly (if it's even possible)). I edited only the [url], [url= and my newly created [url=@ bbcode tags. Their original regexps (dated to 2008) didn't allow invalid characters such as parentheses or white spaces in the url value (which are needed for some Wikipedia pages and file hosting services' URLs), so instead of encoding the URLs' special characters as suggested by others, I just edited the regex to allow alphanumeric characters in the protocols and basically any character in the domain/rest of the url address. The new regexps inside phpbb2's bbencode_second_pass function ($text = post's text): And the unedited phpbb2 declarations: This works perfectly fine with my debugging so far, now I'd like to ask if, by allowing any character to be placed inside the A tag's href attribute I'd exposing my users or myself to any hacker attack?

16913,Questions,"How do I get the right number of pauses after a list in beamer? 
 When I do an list (or list-type) in beamer with the automatic pausing between each item, then there seems to be something wrong with the pauses afterwards. If I put in a pause afterwards then I get a double pause, but if I leave it out then I get no pause. Here's an example: With the pause , I get three pages. Without, I get only one. I want two. Another example (added in edit) of similarly annoying behaviour is in trying to pause within an item: What's going on? More importantly, how do I stop it doing that? It's really annoying! (Added in edit): In response to Michael Underwood's answer: the pause command is so useful and so intuitive that I'd really like to use it. I know that for complicated stuff, I need to use more refined commands, but this doesn't feel complicated. It seems that as soon as I use an automatic list (which is itself a useful shortcut to a more complicated command) then I have to abandon using the pause command. Why can't I use both?

16916,Questions,"Display actual image size within existing PHP code
 I am building a  Wordpress website . Please don't mind that I'm not working on a local or testing server, or my code. It's messy at the moment while I try to figure out this programming bit. By going to my website, you will see a row of images along the top, which is within a jcarousel. It works, but if you hit next until you get to the portrait photo, there is a gap. The gap is because I have to set a width in pixels within my HTML or CSS for the carousel to work correctly. If set to auto , the carousel collapses. Makes sense to me, but it's frustrating that I cannot work around that. I want the landscape and portrait photos to have an identical height of 427, but the width I want it to self-adjust to the actual image size. So I think I understand this bit after playing around for 3 days - I cannot tell you how many carousel codes I've used. Originally I thought that was the problem, and some were. I found out, widths of each image slide are set within the JavaScript, so if I gave it a width of 640, I would get the same result as I am getting now. My first question is this: I'm calling my images from a directory on my server, written specifically for Wordpress (  author ). Here is the code: As you can see, it's calling from the picture-atlantic directory and displaying it within an unordered list, which is required for some reason with my jcarousel. Finally: how can I use this same code to get my images, but also display them at their actual sizes? In the code above, if I define the width and height, it does it for all the images. However, as I mentioned before, I have portrait pictures that use different dimensions.
