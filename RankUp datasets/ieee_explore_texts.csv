65,Aerospace,"In object recognition (classification), it was known that the human brain processes visual information in semantic space mainly, that is, extracting the semantically meaningful features such as line-segments, boundaries, shape and so on. But by recent information processing techniques, these kinds of features cannot be detected by computers robustly so that in computer vision it's still difficult to process visual information as humans do. Computers have to process visual information in data space formed by the robustly detectable but less meaningful features such as colors, textures etc. Therefore, the processing methodology in computers is quite different from that in human beings. In the talk, we will address the main principle of the image recognition (classification) approach in computer vision, its seedtime, main results and the difficulty faced recently. From digital cameras, there is a huge amount of 2D-image data. In computer object recognition (or classification), the data should be transformed into an object-invariant inner representation. In order to solve the problem, we need two key techniques, i.e., a robust detector and an invariant descriptor. People have attempted to solve the two key techniques for a long time but so far they didn't find any efficient solution. Human visual performances are still superior to that of computer vision greatly in many aspects. So as a future direction, computer vision should learn some things from neuroscience and brain science. We will discuss what computer vision can learn from human vision and how it will be affected by the new interdisciplinary research. We may still face many difficulties in the future.","in object recognition -LRB- classification -RRB- , it be know that the human brain process visual information in semantic space mainly , that be , extract the semantically meaningful feature such as line-segment , boundary , shape and so on . but by recent information processing technique , these kind of feature can not be detect by computer robustly so that in computer vision it ' still difficult to process visual information as human do . computer have to process visual information in data space form by the robustly detectable but less meaningful feature such as color , textur etc. therefore , the processing methodology in computer be quite different from that in human being . in the talk , we will address the main principle of the image recognition -LRB- classification -RRB- approach in computer vision , its seedtime , main result and the difficulty face recently . from digital camera , there be a huge amount of 2d-image data . in computer object recognition -LRB- or classification -RRB- , the data should be transform into an object-invariant inner representation . in order to solve the problem , we need two key technique , i.e. , a robust detector and an invariant descriptor . people have attempt to solve the two key technique for a long time but so far they do n't find any efficient solution . human visual performance be still superior to that of computer vision greatly in many aspect . so as a future direction , computer vision should learn some thing from neuroscience and brain science . we will discuss what computer vision can learn from human vision and how it will be affect by the new interdisciplinary research . we may still face many difficulty in the future .",258,1

77,Aerospace,"Phase Shift- Keying (PSK) modulation has been applied widely in most of the data communication system nowadays due to its noise immunity and bandwidth efficiency capability. Analysis of digital modulation is an important component of spectrum monitoring. Furthermore, it has been identified recently that spectrum sensing is part of the function in cognitive radio. Works on bilinear time-frequency distribution (TFD) previously does not represent the phase information of a signal and it is incapable to analyze PSK type of signals. The cross TFD method proposed overcomes this problem, and is able to analyze signal carrying phase information like the class of PSK signals. From the cross time-frequency representation (TFR), signal parameters like the subcarrier frequency, instantaneous phase and bit duration can be estimated. The choice of the window width has significant effect on the accuracy of the phase estimation as well as the frequency resolution of the Time Frequency Representation (TFR). It is shown that the cross TFD with appropriate window width can give a complete representation of a phase modulated signal.","phase shift - keying -LRB- psk -RRB- modulation have be apply widely in most of the data communication system nowadays due to its noise immunity and bandwidth efficiency capability . analysis of digital modulation be an important component of spectrum monitoring . furthermore , it have be identify recently that spectrum sense be part of the function in cognitive radio . work on bilinear time-frequency distribution -LRB- tfd -RRB- previously do not represent the phase information of a signal and it be incapable to analyze psk type of signal . the cross tfd method propose overcome this problem , and be able to analyze signal carry phase information like the class of psk signal . from the cross time-frequency representation -LRB- tfr -RRB- , signal parameter like the subcarrier frequency , instantaneous phase and bit duration can be estimate . the choice of the window width have significant effect on the accuracy of the phase estimation as well as the frequency resolution of the time frequency representation -LRB- tfr -RRB- . it be show that the cross tfd with appropriate window width can give a complete representation of a phase modulate signal .",172,0.6666666666666666

79,Aerospace,"In this paper, we examine an enhancement of pulsed Multiband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (pulsed MB-OFDM) systems for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) applications. The pulsed MB-OFDM system offers an efficient option for fulfilling the UWB high bandwidth channel requirements. This system combines the two major implementations of UWB, namely the impulse radio and the MB-OFDM, in order to capture the advantages of low hardware complexity and low power consumption in both implementations. A modified half-rate Algebraic Time Frequency (ATF) coding will be used to achieve the proposed enhancement of the pulsed system.

80,Aerospace,"Data security is an essential requirement, especially when sending information over a network. Network security has three goals called confidentiality, integrity and availability (or Access). Encryption is the most common technique used to achieve this goal. However, the computer society has not yet agreed on a standard method to measure data security. The ultimate goal of this study is to define security metrics based on different aspects of network security, and then demonstrate how these metrics could be used in Quality of Service (QoS) routing to find the most secure path connecting two distant nodes (source and destination) across an internetwork. Three security metrics are proposed in this document, these metrics have been derived from three important issues of network security, namely: authentication, encryption and traffic filtration techniques (firewalls and intrusion detection systems). The metrics follow different composition rules in that the first is binary, the second is either concave or additive and the last is multiplicative. Routing algorithms that make use of such metrics have been implemented in the C# programming language to test the viability of the proposed solution. Computational effort and blocking probability are the most commonly used performance measures were used to assess the behavior and the performance of these routing algorithms. Results obtained show that the algorithms were able to find feasible paths between communicating parties and helped in making reasonable savings in the computational effort needed to find an acceptable path. Consequently, higher blocking probabilities were encountered, which is thus the price to be paid for the savings.","data security be an essential requirement , especially when send information over a network . network security have three goal call confidentiality , integrity and availability -LRB- or access -RRB- . encryption be the most common technique use to achieve this goal . however , the computer society have not yet agree on a standard method to measure data security . the ultimate goal of this study be to define security metric base on different aspect of network security , and then demonstrate how these metric could be use in quality of service -LRB- qo -RRB- rout to find the most secure path connect two distant node -LRB- source and destination -RRB- across an internetwork . three security metric be propose in this document , these metric have be derive from three important issue of network security , namely : authentication , encryption and traffic filtration technique -LRB- firewall and intrusion detection system -RRB- . the metric follow different composition rule in that the first be binary , the second be either concave or additive and the last be multiplicative . rout algorithm that make use of such metric have be implement in the c # program language to test the viability of the propose solution . computational effort and block probability be the most commonly use performance measure be use to assess the behavior and the performance of these rout algorithm . result obtain show that the algorithm be able to find feasible path between communicate party and help in make reasonable saving in the computational effort need to find an acceptable path . consequently , high block probability be encounter , which be thus the price to be pay for the saving .",254,0.3333333333333333

If effectively planned and encouraged the corporate sector can play a significant role in all the three phases i.e. Pre-disaster, disaster and post-disaster. This paper focuses on approaches executives can take to join forces with the relief organizations. A holistic strategy has been devised, that provides an effective framework of cooperation between the corporate sector and disaster management agencies for dealing with all the three disaster management phases. The study consists of discussions with the team leaders and members of disaster management agencies along with representatives of the corporate sector who had been actively involved in coordinating relief activities. Three major areas of public-private cooperation and partnership decisions have been identified over the life cycle of disaster management process i.e. awareness generation, disaster preparedness and mitigation planning for better disaster management.","disaster , both natural and manmade , of colossal proportion have continue to beleaguer pakistan especially over the last 3 decade . response of the government agency and that of the general community have improve with time but still can be best describe as & # x201c ; reactive & # x201d ; . in the aftermath of the devastating 2005 earthquake corporate sector play its role as a key partner in disaster management . however , corporate sector role have always be limit to contribution in the post disaster management effort . the corporate sector possess huge resource - human , material , technical and financial - and have significant presence in every region of the country . if effectively plan and encourage the corporate sector can play a significant role in all the three phase i.e. pre-disaster , disaster and post-disaster . this paper focus on approach executive can take to join force with the relief organization . a holistic strategy have be devise , that provide an effective framework of cooperation between the corporate sector and disaster management agency for deal with all the three disaster management phase . the study consist of discussion with the team leader and member of disaster management agency along with representative of the corporate sector who have be actively involve in coordinate relief activity . three major area of public-private cooperation and partnership decision have be identify over the life cycle of disaster management process i.e. awareness generation , disaster preparedness and mitigation planning for better disaster management .",231,1

240,Bioengineering,"This paper employs machine learning techniques to develop models that predict gender based on the iris texture features. While there is a large body of research that explores biometrics as a means of verifying identity, there has been very little work done to determine if biometric measures can be used to determine specific human attributes. If it is possible to discover such attributes, they would be useful in situations where a biometric system fails to identify an individual that has not been enrolled, yet still needs to be identified. The iris was selected as the biometric to analyze for two major reasons: (1) quality methods have already been developed to segment and encode an iris image, (2) current iris encoding methods are conducive to selecting and extracting attributes from an iris texture and creating a meaningful feature vector.","this paper employ machine learn technique to develop model that predict gender base on the iris texture feature . while there be a large body of research that explore biometrics as a mean of verify identity , there have be very little work do to determine if biometric measure can be use to determine specific human attribute . if it be possible to discover such attribute , they would be useful in situation where a biometric system fail to identify an individual that have not be enrol , yet still need to be identify . the iris be select as the biometric to analyze for two major reason : -LRB- 1 -RRB- quality method have already be develop to segment and encode an iris image , -LRB- 2 -RRB- current iris encode method be conducive to select and extract attribute from an iris texture and create a meaningful feature vector .",138,0.6666666666666666

243,Bioengineering,"During radiation treatment of lung cancer patients, synchronization of treatment devices and tumor position has been a challenging task due to breathing-induced tumor motion and treatment device latency. One method to mitigate the impact of system latency is to determine the future tumor position. Breathing prediction presents a methodology to determine future tumor position indirectly. Different types of neural networks have been used to predict breathing behavior, but these networks are not able to adapt well to the irregular transient patterns in breathing dynamics. This paper utilizes a second order Volterra predictor for predicting regular and highly irregular breathing behaviors. This paper also compares the performance of Volterra predictor with that of a feed-forward backpropagation network. The results showed that the adaptive performance of the Volterra predictor is not significantly different from that of the neural network for all the breathing cases used in the study, and its ability to adapt to transient behavior greatly outperforms that of neural networks.","during radiation treatment of lung cancer patient , synchronization of treatment device and tumor position have be a challenging task due to breathing-induced tumor motion and treatment device latency . one method to mitigate the impact of system latency be to determine the future tumor position . breathe prediction present a methodology to determine future tumor position indirectly . different type of neural network have be use to predict breathing behavior , but these network be not able to adapt well to the irregular transient pattern in breathing dynamic . this paper utilize a second order volterra predictor for predict regular and highly irregular breathing behavior . this paper also compare the performance of volterra predictor with that of a feed-forward backpropagation network . the result show that the adaptive performance of the volterra predictor be not significantly different from that of the neural network for all the breathing case use in the study , and its ability to adapt to transient behavior greatly outperform that of neural network .",160,0.5

246,Bioengineering,"While medical imaging typically provides massive amounts of data, the automatic extraction of relevant information in a given applicative context remains a difficult challenge in general. With functional MRI (fMRI), the data provide an indirect measurement of brain activity, that can be related to behavioral information. It is now standard to formulate this relation as a machine learning problem where the signal from the entire brain is used to predict a target, typically a behavioral variable. In order to cope with the high dimensionality of the data, the learning method requires a regularization procedure. Among other alternatives, &#x2113;<sub>1</sub> regularization achieves simultaneously a selection of the most predictive features. One limitation of the latter method, also referred to as Lasso in the case of regression, is that the spatial structure of the image is not taken into account, so that the extracted features are often hard to interpret. To obtain more informative and interpretable results, we propose to use the &#x2113;<sub>1</sub> norm of the image radient, a.k.a., the Total Variation (TV), as regularization. TV extracts few predictive regions with piecewise constant weights over the whole brain, and is thus more consistent with traditional brain mapping.

268,Bioengineering,"Non-ideal iris images can significantly affect the accuracy of iris recognition systems for two reasons: 1) they cannot be properly preprocessed by the system; and/or 2) they have poor image quality. However, many traditional iris recognition systems have been deployed in law enforcement, military, or many other important locations. It will be expensive to replace all these systems. It will be desirable if the traditional systems can be transformed to perform in non-ideal situations without an expensive update. In this paper, we propose a method that can help traditional iris recognition systems to work on the non-ideal situation using a video image approach. The proposed method will quickly identify and eliminate the bad quality images from iris videos for further processing. The segmentation accuracy is critical in recognition and would be challenging for traditional systems. The segmentation evaluation is designed to evaluate if the segmentation is valid. The information distance based quality measure is used to evaluate if the image has enough quality for recognition. The segmentation evaluation score and quality score are combined to predict the recognition performance. The research results show that the proposed methods can work effectively and objectively. The combination of segmentation and quality scores is highly correlated with the recognition accuracy and can be used to improve the performance of iris recognition systems in a non-ideal situation. The deployment of such a system would not cost much since the core parts of the traditional systems are not changed and we only need to add software modules.

269,Bioengineering,"Iris recognition has been shown to be one of the most accurate biometrics. However, under non-ideal situations, its recognition accuracy can be reduced dramatically. Under such situations, video images can be used to improve the accuracy. The traditional single image based segmentation method could be inefficient. Video image based thresholding method can help improve the segmentation efficiency. However, traditional thresholding methods are not designed for iris images. In this paper, the multi-level iris video image thresholding method is proposed. It takes advantage of the correlations between consecutive images for video based thresholding. It is an orientation invariant thresholding scheme. K-mean clustering is used to find the clusters and PCA is used to quickly project the image to the clusters. The experimental results show the proposed method is effective. The thresholded images show clear pupil and iris areas, which can help further iris segmentation and processing.

340,Communications,"This article introduces a new particle filtering approach for object tracking in video sequences. The projective particle filter uses a linear fractional transformation, which projects the trajectory of an object from the real world onto the camera plane, thus providing a better estimate of the object position.

This provides a better coverage of the feature space and yields a finer estimate of the posterior density. Experiments conducted on traffic video surveillance sequences show that the variance of the estimated trajectory is reduced, resulting in more robust tracking.","this article introduce a new particle filter approach for object tracking in video sequence . the projective particle filter use a linear fractional transformation , which project the trajectory of an object from the real world onto the camera plane , thus provide a better estimate of the object position . in the propose particle filter , sample be draw from an importance density integrate the linear fractional transformation . this provide a better coverage of the feature space and yield a fine estimate of the posterior density . experiment conduct on traffic video surveillance sequence show that the variance of the estimate trajectory be reduce , result in more robust tracking .",104,0.3333333333333333

633,Engineering_General_Topics,"Typically developing 6-month-olds can discriminate between small and large numerosities. Discrimination between small numbers is only possible in young infants when variables continuous with number (e.g. area or circumference) are also present in the display. However, they succeed on large number discrimination even when such variables are controlled for. This points to the possible existence of two different number systems in infancy. Williams syndrome (WS), is a genetic disorder, for which numerical deficits have been identified in older children and adults. The current study examined whether such deficits originate in infancy. We tested small and large number discrimination in infants and toddlers with WS. While they succeeded in discriminating between 2 and 3 elements when numerosity was confounded with total area, the same infants failed to discriminate between 8 and 16 elements, when continuous variables were controlled for. These findings suggest that a system for tracking certain features of small numbers of objects may be functional in WS, while large number discrimination reveals deficits already in infancy.

The network learns to perform vergence eye movements between natural images of objects by receiving a reward whenever an object is fixated with both eyes. Disparity tuned neurons emerge robustly in the hidden layer during development. The characteristics of the cells' tuning curves depend strongly on the task: if mostly small vergence movements are to be performed, tuning curves become narrower at small disparities, as has been measured experimentally in barn owls.

A novel way to, partly, overcome this problem is embedding with feature points. In this paper we describe a synchronization system based on SIFT feature points. These points are characterized as being a localized feature containing semantic information of the image and can usually be retrieved after the image is attacked. We present an improvement on the work of Lee et al., by using a more robust SIFT algorithm for feature point detection which we called Global SIFT (GLOS) and an adaptation of the Circular Spatial watermarking algorithm using so called mean QIM (CSI).

657,Engineering_General_Topics,"This paper presents Amrita Learning, a web-based, multimedia-enabled, Adaptive Assessment and Learning System for schools. Computer-based adaptive assessments aim to use an optimal and individualized assessment path to determine the knowledge level of students. The new goal for adaptive assessment is based on educational outcomes, which describe what learners must be able to do as a result of items studied. Assessment based on outcomes creates the initial roadmap for the educational model, ensuring that students are not learning items that are already mastered. Learners and instructors can accurately determine their areas of strengths and weaknesses, and use this to determine future instruction. This paper explains the underlying principles used in the initial adaptive assessment followed by evaluation that is closely interwoven with learning. An expert module continuously adjusts the content and method of presentation based on the sequence of learner's recent responses and prior knowledge. The system maintains and updates both the individual learner profile and group profiles. Amrita Learning, targeted to school students, is built upon the principles of spiral learning with mixed presentation from multiple skill areas, thus providing continuous reinforcement in all skill-areas. The proposed competency model has been pilot tested in both city and rural area schools. In the majority of cases where students used it consistently, there were quantifiable improvements in learning levels and performance in schools.

Previous research on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has indicated that a user's actual behavior in technology use is determined by perceived constructs of technology features, such as usefulness and ease of use. However, based on the interpersonal connection perspective, a person's behavioral intention of technology use can also be influenced by user-perceived acceptance of a group within an organization.

846,Engineering_Profession,"Determining the size of the World Wide Web is extremely difficult. The Web can be viewed as the largest data source available and presents a challenging task for effective design and access. One proposed Web mining approach to handling the problem of effective design and access is personalization. With personalization, Web access or the contents of a Web page are modified to better fit the desires of the user. This may involve dynamically creating Web pages that are unique per user or using the desires of a user to determine what Web documents to retrieve. This paper presents a Web mining model based on dynamic clustering and hidden Markov model. The output of the model is some information for dynamically creating a Web page which can best meet the user's desires. The assumption of the dynamic clustering is that if a group of users who have the same interest trend, those pages they have visited are probably related. We propose that human should be the authority to judge the correlation of two pages. First, the model statistic a user's Web browsing records in the log file; find a group of users who have the same interest trend with the user; collect all the pages in which this group of users are interested; calculate the correlation between pages; and cluster the pages into several categories according to a predetermined threshold.

Next, the subjective interestingness values of the new patterns can be computed by comparing these new purchase patterns with existing beliefs.

For most Chinese companies, ERP is still in its planning or initializing stages. Managers in those firms are expecting to know more about what will happen and what they need do after the ERP implementation. Even though some researches about ERP usage in other countries can benefit Chinese practitioners, there is little research on the process of post ERP implementation in China itself. Based on interviews in two manufacturing firms in northeast of China, this study aims to explore the general process of the ERP usage after implementation in Chinese companies from the perspective of ERP performance.

Quality of service (QoS) profiles of Web services are crucial in determining which service best addresses the user desires and objectives. This paper developed a general QoS-based service selection method. By importing the proposed QoS ontology into OWL-S standards, the method can express Web service's nonfunctional attributes in a semantic and extensible way. Web service QoS based selection is formulated as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) which can be solved by using different MCDM models to evaluate QoS criteria of the candidate Web services. The values of quality parameters of a Web service are normalized to a non-negative real-valued number where higher normalized values represent higher levels of service performance.

876,Engineering_Profession,"In this paper, I propose principles for good representation of information applicable to six categories of communication: speeches, written texts, presentations, Web pages, movies/videos, and source programs. For each of these categories, many tips have been proposed for creating good information representation. The meaning of good information representation can be interpreted in two ways: as attractive or impressive, and effective in conveying facts and opinions. Although these two ways cannot be said to be independent of each other, I focus here only the latter. The need to establish explicit principles for good information representation is urgent, because information must be transmitted accurately (without loss of fidelity). Bad information representation is proliferating at a rapid pace because of the Internet. There are common and general principles among the six categories of communication: (1) fitness for the goal and receivers, (2) structural coincidence between contents and form, (3) simplicity, (4) hierarchy, (5) disambiguation, (6) consistency, (7) agreement with conventions, (8) continuity, (9) making blocks of information, (10) three- parts configuration of a block, (11) directness, and (12) portability.

In general it is recommended that a speaker should make the transition between topics explicit by using transition sentences. Such sentences bridge ideas and aid understanding. This paper investigates whether the use of transition sentences has the effects that modern advisors predict. Does the use of transition sentences result in a more coherent representation of the message of the speaker and in a higher appreciation of the speech itself? To explore these questions three variants of one 13-minute lecture were constructed; the only difference among the three was the presence (and place) of a series explicit transition sentences. The results show that the power of such sentences is restricted.

883,Engineering_Profession,"In this article, three digital modulation schemes popular in optical wireless communication systems (OOK, PPM and DPIM) are compared based on bandwidth requirement, power efficiency, transmits-ion capacity and bit- error probability. In OOK, the bandwidth requirement is roughly equivalent to the data rate (R<sub>b</sub>,). PPM achieves higher average power efficiency than OOK at the expense of an increased bandwidth (x4) compared to OOK. Besides, the use of PPM imposes more system complexity compared to OOK since both slot- and symbol-level synchronizations, critical to system performance, are required at the receiver. Unlike PPM, DPIM does not require symbol synchronization since each symbol is initiated with a pulse. Furthermore, DPIM displays a higher transmission capacity by eliminating all the unused time slots from within each symbol. In terms of BER, 4-DPIM displays a performance in between that of OOK and PPM. It is concluded that DPIM is the most efficient scheme in terms of transmission capacity and band-width requirements. When it comes to power and error performance, PPM is the best among the three schemes.","in this article , three digital modulation scheme popular in optical wireless communication system -LRB- ook , ppm and dpim -RRB- be compare base on bandwidth requirement , power efficiency , transmits-ion capacity and bit - error probability . in ook , the bandwidth requirement be roughly equivalent to the data rate -LRB- rb , -RRB- . ppm achieve high average power efficiency than ook at the expense of an increase bandwidth -LRB- x4 -RRB- compare to ook . besides , the use of ppm impose more system complexity compare to ook since both slot - and symbol-level synchronization , critical to system performance , be require at the receiver . unlike ppm , dpim do not require symbol synchronization since each symbol be initiate with a pulse . furthermore , dpim display a high transmission capacity by eliminate all the unused time slot from within each symbol . in term of ber , 4-dpim display a performance in between that of ook and ppm . it be conclude that dpim be the most efficient scheme in term of transmission capacity and band-width requirement . when it come to power and error performance , ppm be the best among the three scheme .",173,0.6666666666666666

The converter practically eliminates both low- and high-frequency current ripple on the battery, thus maximizing battery life without penalizing the volume of the charger circuit. Moreover, operation above resonance is preferred because the power switches turn on at zero current and zero voltage; thus, the freewheeling diodes do not need to have very fast reverse-recovery characteristics. The proposed battery charger circuit has few components and low energy conversion loss, which enhance the system's overall efficiency. Circuit operation modes are determined from the conduction profiles. Operating equations and operating theory are also developed. Experimental results based on a 12V 48Ah battery charger are proposed to validate the analysis and to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.

Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to solve this optimization problem. In this paper, a new adjustable watermarking method based on singular value decomposition is presented so that SVD parameters are adjusted by using the GA considering image complexity and attack resistance.

We then show that global power management is most effective at finer granularities that allow it to adapt to changing workload behavior and thus conclude that on-chip hardware solutions for CMP power management are an important consideration for future CMP microprocessors.","in light of the recent shift towards multi-core processor design , dynamic power-management technique that be design for single-core microprocessor must be augment with large chip-level control . in this paper , we explore the design-tradeoff associate with cmp power management solution in a full-system simulation environment . we show that global power management solution outperform solution that locally manage power per-core . we then show that global power management be most effective at finer granularity that allow it to adapt to change workload behavior and thus conclude that on-chip hardware solution for cmp power management be an important consideration for future cmp microprocessor .",99,0
1097,Geoscience,"A statistical performance simulator is developed to explore the impact of die-to-die (D2D) and within-die (WID) parameter variations on the distributions of maximum clock frequency (FMAX) and throughput for multi-core processors in a future 22nm technology. The simulator integrates a compact analytical throughput model, which captures the key dependencies of multi-core processors, into a statistical simulation framework that models the effects of D2D and WID parameter variations on critical path delays across a die. The salient contributions from this paper are: (1) Product-level variation analysis for multi-core processors must focus on throughput, rather than just FMAX, and (2) Multi-core processors are inherently more variation tolerant than single-core processors due to the larger impact of memory latency and bandwidth on overall throughput. To elucidate these two points, multi-core and single-core processors have a similar chip-level FMAX distribution (mean degradation of 9% and standard deviation of 5%) for multi-threaded applications. In contrast to single-core processors, memory latency and bandwidth constraints significantly limit the throughput dependency on FMAX in multi-core processors, thus reducing the throughput mean degradation and standard deviation by 50%. Since single-threaded applications running on a multi-core processor can execute on the fastest core, mean FMAX and throughput gains of 4% are achieved from the nominal design target.","a statistical performance simulator be develop to explore the impact of die-to-die -LRB- d2d -RRB- and within-die -LRB- wid -RRB- parameter variation on the distribution of maximum clock frequency -LRB- fmax -RRB- and throughput for multi-core processor in a future 22nm technology . the simulator integrate a compact analytical throughput model , which capture the key dependency of multi-core processor , into a statistical simulation framework that model the effect of d2d and wid parameter variation on critical path delay across a die . the salient contribution from this paper be : -LRB- 1 -RRB- product-level variation analysis for multi-core processor must focus on throughput , rather than just fmax , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- multi-core processor be inherently more variation tolerant than single-core processor due to the large impact of memory latency and bandwidth on overall throughput . to elucidate these two point , multi-core and single-core processor have a similar chip-level fmax distribution -LRB- mean degradation of 9 % and standard deviation of 5 % -RRB- for multi-threaded application . in contrast to single-core processor , memory latency and bandwidth constraint significantly limit the throughput dependency on fmax in multi-core processor , thus reduce the throughput mean degradation and standard deviation by 50 % . since single-threaded application run on a multi-core processor can execute on the fast core , mean fmax and throughput gain of 4 % be achieve from the nominal design target .",207,0.6

1109,Geoscience,"This paper provides a polynomial time heuristic for the real-time communication scheduling problem in multi-hop wireless sensor networks.Wireless networks add a new dimension to the real-time communication problem because of interference: a transmission cannot be scheduled on a radio link if another transmission is scheduled on any interfering link. The problem being NP-hard in nature, we propose a novel heuristic that comes into two parts: (1) a scheduler that uses a topological analysis of the network to anticipate the effects of radio interference in order to improve scheduling prioritization, (2) an iterative route update scheme that pushes apart interfering streams and spreads them out over the network to reduce interference and improve schedulability while meeting the deadline requirements. The whole algorithm runs in polynomial time of O(N<sup>3</sup>d), where N and d are the number of streams and maximum deadline respectively. We use a simulation-based study to demonstrate that this algorithm produces near-optimal schedules for approximately 10 packet streams in a 100 node network, where the optimal schedule can be computed. We also show that the overall algorithm is able to schedule as much as 47% more steams than simple heuristics that takes only deadline or interference into account. Of this improvement, 4% - 26% contribution comes from the iterative route update scheme.","this paper provide a polynomial time heuristic for the real-time communication scheduling problem in multi-hop wireless sensor network . wireless network add a new dimension to the real-time communication problem because of interference : a transmission can not be schedule on a radio link if another transmission be schedule on any interfere link . the problem be np-hard in nature , we propose a novel heuristic that come into two part : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a scheduler that use a topological analysis of the network to anticipate the effect of radio interference in order to improve scheduling prioritization , -LRB- 2 -RRB- an iterative route update scheme that push apart interfere stream and spread them out over the network to reduce interference and improve schedulability while meet the deadline requirement . the whole algorithm run in polynomial time of o -LRB- n3d -RRB- , where n and d be the number of stream and maximum deadline respectively . we use a simulation-based study to demonstrate that this algorithm produce near-optimal schedule for approximately 10 packet stream in a 100 node network , where the optimal schedule can be compute . we also show that the overall algorithm be able to schedule as much as 47 % more steam than simple heuristic that take only deadline or interference into account . of this improvement , 4 % - 26 % contribution come from the iterative route update scheme .",212,1
1110,Geoscience,"Wireless sensor networks are now being considered for mission critical applications, which are often largely unattended and need to operate reliably for years. However, due to the real world communication, sensing and failure realities, clock drift, and node faults, the system performance may degrade significantly over time. It is highly desirable that these natural deteriorations can be monitored continuously and can be corrected with self-healing when necessary. In this paper, we introduce a dependency constraint directed self-healing scheme for wireless sensor networks. We reveal that when self-healing services are being composed, certain dependency constraints, including invocation, parameter consistency, control and implicit assumption dependencies must be carefully identified and respected. We illustrate each of these dependency constraints through case studies in 3 different systems covering the typical functions of wireless sensor networks, including sensing, communication and tracking. Our research indicates that, following the dependency constraints in self-healing design is not only a must for the correctness of self-healing services, but is also a key to energy efficient self-healing.","wireless sensor network be now be consider for mission critical application , which be often largely unattended and need to operate reliably for year . however , due to the real world communication , sense and failure reality , clock drift , and node fault , the system performance may degrade significantly over time . it be highly desirable that these natural deterioration can be monitor continuously and can be correct with self-healing when necessary . in this paper , we introduce a dependency constraint direct self-healing scheme for wireless sensor network . we reveal that when self-healing service be be compose , certain dependency constraint , include invocation , parameter consistency , control and implicit assumption dependency must be carefully identify and respect . we illustrate each of these dependency constraint through case study in 3 different system cover the typical function of wireless sensor network , include sense , communication and tracking . our research indicate that , follow the dependency constraint in self-healing design be not only a must for the correctness of self-healing service , but be also a key to energy efficient self-healing .",167,1

1112,Geoscience,"In this paper a concept is presented to develop a sensor arrangement in accordance with different standards to determine position and speed information for a safety Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Different environments require a various selection of available sensors. Possible failures in design, production and maintenance have to be considered. Further failures of any other kind have to be assumed and detected in the system immediately. A single failure must not lead to a drop out of safety. Components, physical mode of operation, environmental interactions, concept of data transmission and the architecture of the system have to be designed in such a way that no fault occurs with a common cause failure. The requirement is to detect an initiating deropement of a funicular. Crosswind and misaligned traverses cause lateral forces. These forces generate a hazard of deropement. In case an initiating deropement is detected, counteractions will be triggered, for example reducing the operation speed or a final stop. The present state of the art is a combination of cable grabbers with deropement switches. This technology reduces the effect of a deropement, but not the deropement itself. Another solution works with safety related proximity switches, which check the position of the rope on the roller. In case of thunderstorms the rope works as a lightning conductor. These currents destroy many of these proximity switches, because they are close to the rope (Fig. 1). A more insensible solution is shown in Fig.2.

Offline computer simulations are used to generate experimental data to build a set of hyperplanes, which form the Security Region for the Wide-area Interconnection. The hyperplanes will be used in real time with State Estimation data and PMU information to evaluate the current security margin and operational transfer capability, to determine the most limiting elements of the grid, and to select optimal remedial actions.

1225,Nuclear_Engineering,"A distributed network of sensors leverages its performance by aggregating information gathered by individual sensors. This process is referred to as sensor fusion. The primary goal of sensor fusion is to process and progressively refine information from multiple sensors to eventually create situation awareness (SA). Sensor fusion requires sensors to exchange data and information over a network with limited capacity. Consequently, fusing raw sensor data may not be desirable, since transporting large amounts of data from sensor nodes will consume a lot of bandwidth, which is in short supply in a typical wireless sensor network. More importantly, when a network has heterogeneous sensors with widely varying signal characteristics, it may not even be possible to mix sensor data from different sensor modalities. To minimize network bandwidth requirements and to deal with the multiple sensing modalities, we propose an alternative approach in which sensors compute their individual estimates, which are then sent to a fusion center that generates global estimates by optimally aggregating individual estimates. Since sensors do not have any prior knowledge about the value of the parameters to be estimated, each sensor independently computes its maximum likelihood estimates of the unknown parameters, based on the limited sensed data gathered in its local vicinity. These estimates along with their distributions are then communicated to a fusion center. The global estimator computes the final maximum likelihood estimates by maximizing a new likelihood function using the distribution of the individual estimates provide by different sensors. Since the distribution of an estimate typically requires a small number of parameters or moments, the amount of data that a sensor needs to communicate over the network is significantly reduced. The performance of the global estimator is evaluated by computing the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the variance of the estimates.","a distribute network of sensor leverage its performance by aggregate information gather by individual sensor . this process be refer to as sensor fusion . the primary goal of sensor fusion be to process and progressively refine information from multiple sensor to eventually create situation awareness -LRB- sa -RRB- . sensor fusion require sensor to exchange data and information over a network with limited capacity . consequently , fusing raw sensor data may not be desirable , since transport large amount of data from sensor node will consume a lot of bandwidth , which be in short supply in a typical wireless sensor network . more importantly , when a network have heterogeneous sensor with widely vary signal characteristic , it may not even be possible to mix sensor data from different sensor modality . to minimize network bandwidth requirement and to deal with the multiple sense modality , we propose an alternative approach in which sensor compute their individual estimate , which be then send to a fusion center that generate global estimate by optimally aggregate individual estimate . since sensor do not have any prior knowledge about the value of the parameter to be estimate , each sensor independently compute its maximum likelihood estimate of the unknown parameter , base on the limited sense data gather in its local vicinity . these estimate along with their distribution be then communicate to a fusion center . the global estimator compute the final maximum likelihood estimate by maximize a new likelihood function use the distribution of the individual estimate provide by different sensor . since the distribution of an estimate typically require a small number of parameter or moment , the amount of data that a sensor need to communicate over the network be significantly reduce . the performance of the global estimator be evaluate by compute the cramer-rao low bind of the variance of the estimate .",294,0.2

1341,Power_and_Energy,"The electricity supply industry, unlike other industries, is hard pressed by the very nature of electricity. The inability to be stored economically and the requirement for instant response to consumption demands are the two major business challenges facing the electricity supply industry's service providers.

1348,Power_and_Energy,"The paper deals with the evaluation of the indirect-lightning performance of overhead distribution networks. The novelty of this contribution is that it takes into account the inherent complexity of distribution networks. These networks are indeed characterized by a plurality of lines (main feeder and laterals) and also by the presence of typical power components (e.g., transformers and surge arresters); they consequently differ considerably from the straight line configuration generally adopted in this type of studies. To accomplish such an evaluation we have extended the general procedure already presented in a previous paper based on the use of the LIOV code along with the Monte Carlo method. The extended procedure combines the advantage of the LIOV-EMTP computer code-that allows the calculation of lightning-induced voltages in complex distribution networks-with a heuristic technique specifically developed and integrated in the Monte Carlo routine in order to reduce the computational effort. The application of the proposed procedure to a set of distribution overhead networks characterized by different topologies, but all of the same length, shows that, in general, the usual single straight-line approach may result into a misestimation of the indirect-lightning performance.

1487,Signal_Processing,"One of the key problems of conventional iris recognition methods is that they are based on processing single iris image and require good image quality as an essential condition. These requisites entail considerable constraints on users for taking iris images. Video based iris recognition can provide convenience and time efficiency to the subjects with undemanding restrains during iris acquisition. These videos which are usually taken of moving subjects at a distance, although convenient to the user, may result in an acquisition approach that can certainly introduce unexpected noise sources to the iris images, impacting as a consequence the verification accuracy for iris recognition. With this dilemma, this study introduces a new segmentation approach for video based iris recognition. The proposed approach consists of two steps. The first step consists of a video frame selection which is to obtain qualified frames from near infrared (NIR) video, where the subjects' eye images are extracted based on the featured reflection spots generated by the specified video camera. The second step is based on an iris segmentation designed to isolate the iris from the eye image. Since iris images obtained from NIR video may suffer from different kinds of noise effects, a new strategy is proposed for iris segmentation to overcome such noise effects and process effectively the eye images (frames) in the presence of noise. More importantly, the proposed iris segmentation strategy would not only separate the iris part from the sclera and pupil, but also can identify the extraneous overlapping parts caused by eyelids, eyelashes, and reflection spots.","one of the key problem of conventional iris recognition method be that they be base on process single iris image and require good image quality as an essential condition . these requisite entail considerable constraint on user for take iris image . video base iris recognition can provide convenience and time efficiency to the subject with undemand restrain during iris acquisition . these video which be usually take of move subject at a distance , although convenient to the user , may result in an acquisition approach that can certainly introduce unexpected noise source to the iris image , impact as a consequence the verification accuracy for iris recognition . with this dilemma , this study introduce a new segmentation approach for video base iris recognition . the proposed approach consist of two step . the first step consist of a video frame selection which be to obtain qualified frame from near infrar -LRB- nir -RRB- video , where the subject ' eye image be extract base on the featured reflection spot generate by the specify video camera . the second step be base on an iris segmentation design to isolate the iris from the eye image . since iris image obtain from nir video may suffer from different kind of noise effect , a new strategy be propose for iris segmentation to overcome such noise effect and process effectively the eye image -LRB- frame -RRB- in the presence of noise . more importantly , the propose iris segmentation strategy would not only separate the iris part from the sclera and pupil , but also can identify the extraneous overlap part cause by eyelid , eyelash , and reflection spot .",256,0.5714285714285714

1560,Transportation,"This paper proposes a method to detect the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) phase 1 messages in IPSec VPN, which is called Context-based Deep Packet Inspection (CDPI). In conventional IPSec VPN detection methods, the packet filter firewall only detects the heads of the IP packets and other protocols. Therefore, if the attackers impersonate messages of the same heads as the actual IPSec messages, the conventional methods are not aware of the spurious messages. The proposed method CDPI can not only detect the heads of the messages, but also analyze the context of the IKE messages. Through the context analysis, we can easily find whether the IKE phase 1 messages are actual IPSec messages or imitations. Furthermore, the analysis results can indicate the integrality of the IKE phase 1 exchange, which shows whether the IPSec VPN is established. The result of our experiment shows CPDI is an efficient method to ensure the validity and integrality of IKE messages.","this paper propose a method to detect the internet key exchange -LRB- ike -RRB- phase 1 message in ipsec vpn , which be call context-based deep packet inspection -LRB- cdpi -RRB- . in conventional ipsec vpn detection method , the packet filter firewall only detect the head of the ip packet and other protocol . therefore , if the attacker impersonate message of the same head as the actual ipsec message , the conventional method be not aware of the spurious message . the propose method cdpi can not only detect the head of the message , but also analyze the context of the ike message . through the context analysis , we can easily find whether the ike phase 1 message be actual ipsec message or imitation . furthermore , the analysis result can indicate the integrality of the ike phase 1 exchange , which show whether the ipsec vpn be establish . the result of our experiment show cpdi be an efficient method to ensure the validity and integrality of ike message .",156,0.5

Implemented as a wireless steering wheel, this interface allows control of in-car devices; and detachability permits their control outside the car, as well as providing safety, as removing the steering wheel or just its radio module renders the car inoperative. In addition to the in-car wireless system an 802.11g WLAN has been implemented which utilises its larger range to provide car-to-pit and potentially car-to-car voice and data transmission. For the realisation of both concepts the Cardiff Formula Student car has been used as a test-bed.","the paper work investigate a flexible and integrated driver interface concept through the utilisation of wireless technology . the display of in-car sensor parameter and their control have be implement use a bidirectional wireless system . the wireless system be base on the common bluetooth standard , which permit a straightforward interface with numerous device such as portable digital assistant , mobile hand-set or navigation equipment . lcd display provide a flexible driver interface for numerical and graphical information . implement as a wireless steering wheel , this interface allow control of in-car device ; and detachability permit their control outside the car , as well as provide safety , as remove the steer wheel or just its radio module render the car inoperative . in addition to the in-car wireless system an 802.11 g wlan have be implement which utilise its large range to provide car-to-pit and potentially car-to-car voice and data transmission . for the realisation of both concept the cardiff formula student car have be use as a test-bed .",159,0.75
1581,Transportation,"In the EU funded Integrated Project APROSYS, a side pre-crash sensing system will be set up consisting of a stereo video rig and a radar network. A second goal of APROSYS is to provide tools for the efficient development of future products based on such a sensing system. If a stereo rig points to the side of a moving road vehicle, then maximum angular velocities in azimuth are typically very large. Synchronous operation of the stereo video cameras therefore becomes highly important for correct depth estimation, and hence crucial for pre-crash sensing. This paper proposes a tool for automated verification of the synchronicity of a stereo rig. It consists of a running light clock and automatic image analysis. An error model relates synchronization errors to depth estimation errors. For a given pair of cameras, the tool is applied to give an upper bound to the resulting depth estimation error for the APROSYS application scenario. The tool can be used as a standard for quality control of future product developments","in the eu fund integrate project aprosy , a side pre-crash sense system will be set up consist of a stereo video rig and a radar network . a second goal of aprosy be to provide tool for the efficient development of future product base on such a sense system . if a stereo rig point to the side of a move road vehicle , then maximum angular velocity in azimuth be typically very large . synchronous operation of the stereo video camera therefore become highly important for correct depth estimation , and hence crucial for pre-crash sense . this paper propose a tool for automate verification of the synchronicity of a stereo rig . it consist of a run light clock and automatic image analysis . an error model relate synchronization error to depth estimation error . for a give pair of camera , the tool be apply to give an upper bind to the result depth estimation error for the aprosy application scenario . the tool can be use as a standard for quality control of future product development",169,0.5
1582,Transportation,"A utility-connected wind-power generation scheme using permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) in conjunction with a direct AC-AC matrix converter is proposed. The matrix converter converts the high-frequency of a micro-turbine generator to a conventional frequency of the utility system, based on a novel switching strategy. The control algorithm regulates magnitude and phase-angle of the converter output voltage to accommodate real and reactive power flow requirements of the utility system. The system enables optimal speed tracking for maximum energy capture from the wind and high performance active and reactive power regulation. The paper describes the operating principles of this power generation scheme. Emphasis is given to 3-2 matrix converters for 3f&#x2013;1f AC voltage/frequency for conversion control of system. The three-step voltage commutation sequence of the matrix converter is highlighted here. Simulation studies of the proposed power generation system were carried out.

1583,Transportation,"For the vertically integrated monopolistic environment in the past, economic dispatch and Unit Commitment (UC) were defined as finding and scheduling generating units in order to minimize the total production cost of utility and constraints such as power demand and spinning reserve are met. These problems under deregulated environment, on the other hand, are more complex and more competitive than traditional problems. Generation Companies (GENCO's) solves economic dispatch and unit commitment problem not for minimizing total production cost as before but for maximizing their own profit. Hence, power prices become an important factor in decision making process. This paper presents a hybrid model between Lagrange relaxation and Genetic algorithm to schedule generators economically based on forecasted information such as power prices and demand, with an objective to maximize profit of Generation Company. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique. Test results for 10 generating units 24 hours system are compared with those obtained from traditional unit commitment.","for the vertically integrate monopolistic environment in the past , economic dispatch and unit commitment -LRB- uc -RRB- be define as finding and scheduling generate unit in order to minimize the total production cost of utility and constraint such as power demand and spinning reserve be meet . these problem under deregulate environment , on the other hand , be more complex and more competitive than traditional problem . generation company -LRB- genco 's -RRB- solve economic dispatch and unit commitment problem not for minimize total production cost as before but for maximize their own profit . hence , power price become an important factor in decision make process . this paper present a hybrid model between lagrange relaxation and genetic algorithm to schedule generator economically base on forecast information such as power price and demand , with an objective to maximize profit of generation company . simulation be carry out to evaluate the performance of the propose technique . test result for 10 generate unit 24 hour system be compare with those obtain from traditional unit commitment .",162,0.75
1584,Transportation,"Urban buses have nowadays an important challenge which is to respect the local nuisances such as air pollution and noise while offering to their passengers a high level of accessibility and comfort. Hybrid drivelines are one potential alternative to respond to these constraints. In that context, the Transport and Environment Laboratory (LTE) of the INRETS is collaborating with an urban buses manufacturer with the aim to develop and optimize a 5.5 m, 22 passenger series hybrid plug in microbus. This paper presents the first phases of our research. Firstly, the microbus components description, the actual energy management and the traction motor working are presented. Secondly, the measurement phase carried out on the GRUAU's test bus site in Laval elaborates a start point to understand the various energy flows. After that, the model of the microbus's processing is developed using the LTE library VEHLIB and validated with measurements. Thus, some suggestions about new energy management laws are proposed in order to optimize the consumption of the internal combustion engine together with the battery behavior.","urban bus have nowadays an important challenge which be to respect the local nuisance such as air pollution and noise while offer to their passenger a high level of accessibility and comfort . hybrid driveline be one potential alternative to respond to these constraint . in that context , the transport and environment laboratory -LRB- lte -RRB- of the inret be collaborate with an urban bus manufacturer with the aim to develop and optimize a 5.5 m , 22 passenger series hybrid plug in microbu . this paper present the first phase of our research . firstly , the microbu component description , the actual energy management and the traction motor work be present . secondly , the measurement phase carry out on the gruau 's test bus site in laval elaborate a start point to understand the various energy flow . after that , the model of the microbu 's processing be develop use the lte library vehlib and validate with measurement . thus , some suggestion about new energy management law be propose in order to optimize the consumption of the internal combustion engine together with the battery behavior .",173,0.3333333333333333
1585,Transportation,"A new class of colloidal dielectric fluids is formulated with the objective of enhancing the dielectric performance of mineral oil for application in power system. TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles modified by different organic reagents are suspended by means of sonication. Dielectric strength measurements are carried out under AC for a number of different colloidal systems with varying particle mass fraction. It was found that breakdown voltages under power frequency condition have been improved at the optimum composition. The enhancement of breakdown strength (50Hz) of transformer oil-based nanofluid is mainly attributed to dielectric property of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, which may act as electron traps in the process of electron transfer in electrically stressed nanofluids. Furthermore, the high specific surface area of nanoparticles also increases the probability of electron scattering in the nanofluids, which reduces the impact energy of electrons and prevents the oil from ionizing. All these results confirmed that transformer oil modified with TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles hold a promise to improve its insulating properties.","a new class of colloidal dielectric fluid be formulate with the objective of enhance the dielectric performance of mineral oil for application in power system . tio2 nanoparticle modify by different organic reagent be suspend by mean of sonication . dielectric strength measurement be carry out under ac for a number of different colloidal system with vary particle mass fraction . it be find that breakdown voltage under power frequency condition have be improve at the optimum composition . the enhancement of breakdown strength -LRB- 50hz -RRB- of transformer oil-based nanofluid be mainly attribute to dielectric property of tio2 nanoparticle , which may act as electron trap in the process of electron transfer in electrically stress nanofluid . furthermore , the high specific surface area of nanoparticle also increase the probability of electron scattering in the nanofluid , which reduce the impact energy of electron and prevent the oil from ionize . all these result confirm that transformer oil modify with tio2 nanoparticle hold a promise to improve its insulate property .",160,1
